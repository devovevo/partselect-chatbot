Appliance: Dishwasher
Symptoms:
   - Noisy
   - Causes
       -- Pump: A defective pump could be the reason your dishwasher is making loud noises. The function of the pump is to pressurize the spray arms, and in most models, it is also used to drain the water. The pump sits at the bottom of the dishwasher and typically consists of two separate compartments; one for wash or circulation and the other for draining. The circulation part of the pump will typically consist of the wash impeller and the filter components while the drain portion will consist of a drain impeller and a chopper blade or in some cases, a solenoid operated diverter. The impellers are driven by an electric motor that is attached to the bottom or side of the pump. How to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter: Unplug your dishwasher before beginning this test; you will be handling electrical components. Remove the pump in order to test it. The pump is usually found behind the lower access panel. Using a multimeter on Rx1, place the probes onto the terminals to test for continuity. You should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero. To test the ground connection, with one probe still on a terminal, touch the other probe to the bare metal housing of the pump. You should not receive any reading from this test. If your test results do not match those above, you will need a replacement pump.
       -- Wash Arm Bearing Ring & Spray Arm Seal: If your dishwasher is noisy, the cause could be a wash arm seal or bearing ring. These parts are plastic rings that support the wash arm or the spray arm and that the arm rotates on. Either of these parts could be loose or be worn, causing the spray arm to not function properly. How to inspect your wash arm bearing ring & spray arm seal: While you will not be disassembling your appliance, we still recommend unplugging your appliance before beginning. Locate your wash arm bearing ring & spray arm seal. They will be found attached to the spray/wash arms. Visually inspect them for signs of wear, cracking, or damage. You may need to remove the spray/wash arms to fully inspect them, depending on your model. If you find signs of the above symptoms, you will need replacement wash arm bearing rings and/or spray arm seals.
       -- Spray Arms: Water is forced through the dishwasher spray arms to spray water and detergent around the dishwasher. All dishwashers have a lower spray arm located at the bottom of the dishwasher, and some dishwashers also have middle or upper spray arms located below the top dish rack or at the top of the dishwasher tub. How to inspect dishwasher spray arms: For safety, disconnect the power from your appliance before beginning. Manually spin your spray arms to ensure they are not hitting the racks and are turning freely. The spray arms should not be wobbly. Visually inspect your spray arms for any signs of wear, cracking, or damage. If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need replacement spray arms.
   - Door latch failure
   - Causes
       -- Door Latch Assembly: If your door latch is not working properly, the first thing to inspect should be the door catch. The door catch is attached to the top of the dishwasher tub and is normally adjustable. If not adjusted properly it can cause the door latch to not activate and will prevent the dishwasher from working, or it may not close the door tight enough to prevent a leak. The door latch may also be worn and no longer creates a tight fit, in which case the door latch will need to be replaced.  How to test a dishwasher door latch assembly with a multimeter: Verify that you have unplugged your dishwasher before beginning. The door latch assembly is most often found inside the inner door panel, near the top of the door. Remove your inner door panel and locate the door latch assembly. Inspect the door catch to verify that it is mechanically activating the switches. If it is, remove the switches in order to test them for continuity. Set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of exactly or nearly zero. If your test produces any other reading, you will need a replacement door latch assembly.
   - Leaking
   - Causes
       -- Pump: A defective pump and/or pump seal may be the cause of a dishwasher leak. The function of the pump is to circulate water in the dishwasher and in some models, to drain the water as well. The pump typically consists of two separate compartments; one for wash or circulation and the other for draining. The circulation part of the pump will typically consist of the wash impeller and the filter components while the drain portion will consist of a drain impeller and a chopper blade or in some cases, a solenoid operated diverter. How to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter: Disconnect the power from your appliance before beginning. On most models, the pump will be found behind the lower access panel. Locate and remove your dishwasher pump in order to test it. To test for continuity, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes. This test should produce a reading of exactly or nearly zero. You should also check the ground connection of the pump. To do this, leave one probe on the terminal and touch the other to the bare metal housing of the pump. This test should not produce any reading. If your readings differ from the results above, you will need a replacement pump. 
       -- Door Gasket: If water appears to be leaking around the front of the dishwasher, the problem may be with the door gasket. The dishwasher door gasket or seal is normally made of soft rubber or vinyl and goes around the door or tub opening of the dishwasher, creating a watertight seal. Some dishwasher models have rubber baffles located at the bottom corners of the tub opening that prevent water leaking in that area. When vinyl or rubber ages, it can become less flexible or even brittle and may damage easily or not seal properly. How to inspect a door gasket on a dishwasher: Open your dishwasher door to locate the door gasket, and baffles if applicable. Visually inspect the gasket for any signs of wearing, damage, missing pieces, or misalignment. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement door gasket.
       -- Water Inlet Valve: The water inlet valve feeds the water from your home's main water line into the dishwasher and could be the source of a leak. The inlet valve can be found behind the lower kick plate. The hot water inlet supply to the valve may be copper tubing, rubber hose or braided hose. How to test a dishwasher water inlet valve: Similar to most other inspections, begin by disconnecting your appliance from both the power and the water source. In order to access the water inlet valve, you will need to remove the lower access panel of your appliance. The valve will likely be located on the left side. Begin by inspecting the body of the valve. You are looking for any signs of cracking, damage, wear, or any other indication of a leak. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve. 
       -- Dispensers & Grommets: The detergent dispenser and the rinse aid dispenser are normally located on the inner door panel of the dishwasher. Some models use a dispenser assembly that is attached to the panel with screws and a gasket to seal against water leaks. Other models may use a dispenser that is molded into the door panel but uses a dispenser latch assembly that is attached to the back of the inner panel and use a rubber grommet to seal around the dispenser latch where it protrudes through the door panel. If you have a water leak that appears to come from the front of your dishwasher, the dispenser gasket or the dispenser latch grommet may be the cause. How to inspect a dishwasher detergent/rinse aid dispenser & grommets: For safety, unplug your dishwasher before beginning. Open the dishwasher door to visually inspect the dispenser. First, inspect the lever for cracking or damage, a broken lever would prevent the dispenser from opening or closing properly. Next, inspect the dispenser cover for any wear or damage. Finally, inspect the container itself for cracks or other damage. If you find any issues while performing the inspections above, you will need a replacement dispenser.
       -- Spray Arm: Water is forced through the dishwasher spray arms to spray water and detergent around the dishwasher. All dishwashers have a lower spray arm located at the bottom of the dishwasher, and some dishwashers also have middle or upper spray arms located below the top dish rack or at the top of the dishwasher tub. Most spray arms are made of plastic which can crack or warp enough to change the spray pattern significantly. Metal spray arms can become damaged or separate at the seams which can also alter the spray pattern. These conditions can cause water to be directed at the bottom of the door where there is no gasket and therefore creating a water leak. How to inspect dishwasher spray arms: While not crucial, we recommend you unplug your dishwasher before starting this inspection. Begin by inspecting the arms for any signs of cracking, wear, or any other damage. Next, manually spin the spray arms. You should be feeling to see if there is any resistance, if they are wobbling, or if they hit the dish racks. Additionally, inspect to see if any of the holes in the arms are clogged, clear out anything you may find. If you find any of the issues described above, you will need replacement spray arms.
       -- Float & Float Switch: The float and float switch are used as a safety device to prevent the dishwasher from overfilling with water. The float is located inside of the tub at the bottom of the dishwasher and the float switch is located beneath the tub directly below the float. The float lifts as the water level in the dishwasher rises, and when the proper water level is reached, the stem of the float activates the float switch to turn off the water inlet valve. A malfunctioning float or float switch could cause the water level to be too high and create a leak. The proper water level is normally just to the heating element on the bottom of the tub. If the water level in your dishwasher is too high, then you should suspect that the float or float switch may be the cause of the problem. How to test a dishwasher float switch with a multimeter: Disconnect your dishwasher from the power source as well as the water supply. The float switch will be found inside your dishwasher's tub; you will need to remove the lower access panel to access it. The switch is usually located directly below the float assembly, once you have located it, remove it in order to test it. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the switch's terminals with the probes to test for continuity. You should receive a reading of zero or infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on the switch's button, this should change it to the opposite extreme (from zero to infinity, or infinity to zero). If your test results differ from those above, you will need a replacement float switch.
       -- Hose Clamps & Hoses: The hose clamps secure the drain hose and the circulating hose to the dishwasher pump. These hoses and clamps can be found by removing the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher. If the clamps have come loose or the hoses have cracks in them, it could be the cause of a leak. Be sure to check the clamps on both the drain hose and the circulating hose.  How to inspect dishwasher hoses: Disconnect the water supply as well as the power source from your appliance before beginning. The hoses are usually found behind the lower access panel (or kickplate). You will need to remove this in order to locate them. You will be checking two hoses, both of which are connected to a pump below the lower spray arm: The drain hose and the recirculation hose. Remove both hoses in order to inspect them. Visually inspect the hoses for any signs or wear, cracking, or damage. Attempt to run water through each to identify if there is a blockage inside the hose. If you find any issues while performing the inspection above, you will need a replacement hose.
   - Will not start
   - Causes
       -- Door Latch Or Door Latch Switch: If your dishwasher won't start, the problem could be the door latch or door latch switches. The door latch assembly is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to prevent water from leaking and it also incorporates the door latch switches that supply power to the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches. How to test a dishwasher door latch assembly with a multimeter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. Begin by removing the inner door panel to gain access to the door latch assembly. It is usually found at the top of the door. Once you have located it, verify that the door catch activates the door latch switches by inserting the catch into the assembly. If the switches are being activated mechanically, remove the switches to check them for continuity. Using a multimeter on Rx1, touch the probes to the switch's terminals. This should produce a reading of zero or nearly zero. If you receive a different reading, you will need a replacement door latch assembly.
       -- Timer Or Electronic Control: If you have determined that the door latch assembly is operating properly and your dishwasher still won't start, the next step would be to look at the timer or electronic control. The first step of the dishwasher cycle is normally a drain function to remove any standing water in the tub. If you do not hear the drain pump motor running, then you should look at the timer or electronic control as a possible cause. On manual timer models, the timer is used to supply power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit and drain pump motor at the proper sequence in the cycle. The timer uses a series of electrical contacts that are driven by a small motor all of which are encased in the timer housing. How to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate and remove the timer. It will most likely be found in the control panel, but it is also often found behind the lower kick plate. Some timers may have multiple sets of contacts/wires, if this is true for your model, you will need to refer to your wiring diagram to determine which contacts to test. Set your multimeter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer.
       -- Selector Switch: The selector switch on a dishwasher is used to select different options for the individual cycles, such as heated dry and heated wash cycles. Depending on the model involved, the switch may be used in the motor or fill circuit and could cause a dishwasher to not start if it were defective or if the selector buttons were not fully depressed. Check to ensure that the switch is properly depressed before attempting any disassembly. The contacts of the selector switch can be checked for continuity with a multimeter using the schematic diagram as a guide. How to test a dishwasher selector switch with a multimeter: Begin by disconnecting your appliance from the power source. Remove the inner door panel of your dishwasher in order to locate the selector switch. It most likely will be found on the control panel. Once you have located it, ensure that the switch is properly depressed. If it is, remove it from the appliance in order to test it. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the terminals of the switch, you will need to test each button individually. This should produce a reading of infinity. Next, with the probes still on the terminals, press in on the button of the terminals you are testing. This should change your reading to zero. Repeat this test for all other buttons. If any of your readings do not match the results above, you will need a replacement selector switch.
       -- Motor Start Relay: Some models of dishwashers use a start relay on the main pump motor. The start relay is used to supply power to the motor start windings until the motor is running and has a moving plunger inside that operates a set of contacts. If your dishwasher won't start and you have verified that you are getting power from the control circuit to the motor, then the motor start relay may be defective.  How to test a dishwasher motor start relay: Ensure that you have unplugged your dishwasher before beginning. The motor start relay is normally located next to the pump. Remove the lower access panel of your dishwasher in order to locate the motor start relay. Once you have found it, remove it in order to test it. After referring to your wiring diagram, set your multimeter to Rx1 and begin by testing the coil portion of the relay for continuity. This test should produce a reading of zero or nearly zero. Next, you will need to manually activate the relay by turning it upside down and allowing the plunger to drop. Once it is activated, touch the probes to the terminals of the relay. This test should also produce a reading of zero or nearly zero. If your test results differ from those above, you will need a replacement motor start relay.
       -- Thermal Fuse: Some models of electronic controlled dishwashers use a thermal fuse to protest the control board. The thermal fuse is normally located on the top side of the circuit board assembly with two wires attached to it. When the thermal fuse fails, the control board will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. How to test a dishwasher thermal fuse with a multimeter: Unplug your appliance before beginning this test, you will be handling electrical components. Remove the inner door of your dishwasher in order to access the control panel. The thermal fuse will be attached to the control panel by 2 wires, carefully disconnect these wires and remove the thermal fuse in order to test it. With a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the fuse's contacts with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero. If you do not receive this reading, you will need a replacement thermal fuse.
       -- Drive Motor: A dishwasher's drive motor is the part that circulates the water to wash the items inside. Electrical power to operate the drive motor is supplied through the timer, or the electronic control, in conjunction with a start relay. If the dishwasher won't start after the start relay sends power to the motor, this could indicate that the drive motor is defective. You may also hear a loud, humming noise coming from the motor – this could indicate a seized motor, which would need to be replaced.  How to test a dishwasher drive motor with a multimeter: Before starting, ensure that you have disconnected your dishwasher from the power source. Remove the lower access panel of your appliance in order to locate the drive motor. Once you have located it, carefully disconnect the wires attached to it and remove it in order to test it for continuity. With the motor removed from the appliance, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the motor's terminals. A functional drive motor will produce a reading of zero or nearly zero. Next, test the ground connection by moving one of the probes to the bare metal housing of the motor. This test should not produce any reading.  If either of your tests produces different readings, you will need a replacement drive motor.
   - Not drying dishes properly
   - Causes
       -- Heating Element: A malfunctioning heating element may be the cause for dishes not drying. To test the heating element, first, make sure that power to your dishwasher is turned off, and then check for continuity with a multi-meter. How to test the heating element in a dishwasher with a multimeter: Unplug your dishwasher before attempting this test. Your heating element will be found inside the dishwasher, attached to the bottom of the tub. It may be covered or uncovered. If it is covered, remove the cover. In order to disconnect the heating element, you will need to remove the lower access panel. Remove the wires attached to the heating element's terminals by carefully grasping the metal connector, do not pull on the wire itself. To test the element, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective. If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer's recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element.
       -- High Limit Thermostat: The high limit thermostat acts as a safety device that keeps the dishwasher from getting too hot. If the thermostat is malfunctioning, it could shut off the heat before your dishes are finished drying. How to test a dishwasher high limit thermostat with a multimeter: Ensure that you unplug your appliance before beginning this inspection. Locate and remove the thermostat in order to test it for continuity. In most models, it can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, behind the lower access panel. Set your multimeter to Rx1 mode and touch the terminals with the probes. When your thermostat is at room temperature, you should receive a reading of infinity. If you place the thermostat next to a warm lamp, you should receive a reading of zero. If your thermostat produces different results, you will need a replacement high limit thermostat.
       -- Rinse Aid Dispenser: The rinse aid or the rinse aid dispensing cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not fully drying your dishes. Without the rinse aid, the dishes will not shed water easily and will not dry properly.  How to inspect a dishwasher rinse aid dispenser: This inspection is very simple; you will not need to disassemble your appliance or have any tools to complete this inspection. Your rinse aid dispenser will be found on the inside of the door, remove the cap from the dispenser. After verifying that there is rinse aid in the chamber, inspect the cap and chamber for any signs of discoloration, warping, or any other damage. If you find any issues with your rinse aid dispenser while performing this inspection, you will need a replacement rinse aid dispenser.
   - Not draining
   - Causes
       -- Piston & Nut Assembly: Some models of dishwashers utilize a check valve as part of the drain pump. Within the check valve, there is the piston and nut assembly. If your dishwasher is not draining water properly, the piston and nut assembly could be the source of the problem.  How to inspect a dishwasher piston & nut assembly: Disconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate your piston & nut assembly. It likely will be found on the bottom of the tub, beneath the sump cover.  Inspect your piston & nut assembly to determine if it is functioning properly. The assembly should move up and down freely. When the piston is in the down position, it should form a tight seal. If it is not forming a complete seal, the dishwasher will not completely pump out the water. If you find any issues while performing the inspection, you will need a replacement piston & nut assembly.
       -- Drain Pump & Motor: All dishwashers will have a method to drain the water. Most models will have a single motor driven pump with two separate compartments, one for circulation and one for drain, each with its own impeller. Other types will have a separate drain pump, and some will utilize the main circulating pump in conjunction with a drain solenoid and diverter valve or flapper. On models that use a separate drain pump, you should check to see if there is any obstruction to the input and output of the pump and also verify that there is power getting to the pump motor during the drain portion of the cycle. How to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter: Before beginning, ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source. Locate and remove your dishwasher pump. It likely will be found behind the lower access panel. Once you have removed it, using a multimeter on Rx1 mode, touch the pump's terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero. Next, you should test the ground connection by touching one of the probes to the bare metal housing while leaving one on a terminal. This test should not produce any reading. If the results of your tests are different from the above, you will need a replacement pump.
       -- Check Valve Flapper: Some dishwasher models will use a check valve in the drain outlet. The check valve is used to allow water to flow in one direction but will prevent the dirty water from re-entering the dishwasher. If you suspect that the drain hose has a restriction or if you find that wastewater is getting back into the dishwasher tub, then the check valve is most likely the problem. How to inspect the check valve flapper in a dishwasher: To ensure your safety, unplug your dishwasher before beginning this inspection. Locate your check valve flapper in order to inspect it. In most models, it will be found on the outlet port of the drain pump or housing. You will need to remove the lower access panel in order to inspect it. Visually inspect the flapper for any signs of wear or damage. You should also check to see if there is any dirt or debris preventing the flapper from moving freely, remove anything you may find. If your valve is damaged, or if you find no objects preventing it from opening properly, you will need a replacement check valve flapper.
       -- Belt: Some older dishwashers may use a belt driven pump. If the belt has come off or is slipping, then the pump that drains the dishwasher won't function properly. How to inspect a dishwasher belt: Similar to other dishwasher inspections, disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. Your dishwasher belt will be found behind the lower access panel, attached to a pulley on the pump assembly and to another pulley on the motor assembly. Remove the belt in order to closely inspect it. Looking for any signs of burning, stretching, cracking, damage, or wear, inspect the belt. If you find any issues while inspecting it, you will need a replacement belt. 
       -- Timer: Some dishwashers will use a mechanical timer to operate the cycles. The timer controls the main pump motor as well as the drain solenoid or separate drain pump motor if your model has that style. The timer is normally located in the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door. You will require a wiring diagram and schematic to identify the correct timer contacts that control the drain cycle. These can then be checked for continuity with a multi-meter and if defective then the timer will need to be replaced. How to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter: Unplug your dishwasher before beginning this test. Your timer will likely be found either in the control panel or behind the lower kickplate. Locate and remove your appliance's timer in order to test it. If your model has multiple sets of contacts/wires, you will need to refer to your owner's manual to determine which sets to test. Remove the timer from your appliance, set your multimeter to Rx1000, and touch the contacts/wires with the probes. In most models, a functional timer will produce a reading of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies from model to model. Please refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading you should see. If the results of your test are different than the manufacturer's guidelines, you will need a replacement timer.
       -- Drain Hose: A dishwasher will not drain properly if it has a restricted or clogged drain hose. Restrictions typically appear most often at the outlet from the pump or drain housing where a check valve may be located, at the input to the household drain system or anywhere that a kink may have formed in the drain hose. If food debris has caused a restriction, then you should check the condition of the food chopper as a possible source of the problem. How to inspect a dishwasher drain hose: Verify that the water and power sources have been disconnected from your dishwasher before beginning this inspection. Remove the lower access panel of your appliance and locate the drain. It will be connected to a pump below the lower spray arm. Remove the hose in order to inspect the drain hose closely. You are looking for any visible signs of cracking, damage or wear. You should also attempt to run water through the hose to determine if there is a blockage inside. If any issues are found while doing the inspections above, you will need a replacement hose.
   - Will not fill with water
   - Causes
       -- Water Inlet Valve: The water inlet valve is used to fill the dishwasher with the proper amount of hot water and is controlled by the timer or electronic control. The valve will be located behind the lower access panel and will have two wires attached to it, an outlet hose to the tub and a hot water inlet from the household supply. If your dishwasher does not fill, then you should first check the inlet supply to verify that you have enough water pressure.  How to inspect a dishwasher water inlet valve: Unplug your dishwasher and disconnect the water supply before starting. Locate your water inlet valve. It is commonly found on the lower left side of your dishwasher. You likely will need to remove the lower access panel to locate it.  Looking for any signs of damage, wear, or cracking, visually inspect the water inlet valve. If your valve shows signs of any of the symptoms described above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.
       -- Float: A malfunctioning float could cause the dishwasher to not fill with water. The acts as a safety device that prevents the dishwasher from overfilling with water. The float rises with the water level in the dishwasher and when the proper level is reached, the float will trigger the float switch to turn off the water inlet valve. How to check a dishwasher float assembly: Before beginning, verify that you have unplugged your appliance. Begin by opening your dishwasher door and removing the cover over the float assembly. Once you've done that, manually lift the float and let it drop multiple times, it should move freely, if it does not, remove the float to remove any foreign objects in the guide tube. You should also inspect the float for any visible wear or damage. Remove the lower access panel to determine if the float is mechanically engaging with the float switch. If you find any issues while performing this inspection, you will need a replacement float.
       -- Float Switch: When the float switch is triggered by the float, power to the water inlet valve is interrupted and it stops the flow of water into the dishwasher. How to test a dishwasher float switch with a multimeter: Disconnect your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this inspection; you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove the float switch. It will be found behind the lower access panel, sitting directly below the float assembly. Use caution when disconnecting the wires from the switch, do not pull directly on the wires. Once you have removed it, test the float switch by setting your multimeter to Rx1 and touching the probes to the switch's terminals. This should produce a reading of zero or infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on the switch's button, this should change the reading to the opposite extreme (from zero to infinity or infinity to zero). If your test results produce readings that differ from the above, you will need a replacement float switch.
       -- Door Switch: The door switch is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. If the door switch or switches are malfunctioning the dishwasher will not fill with water. How to test a dishwasher door switch with a multimeter: Before beginning, ensure that you unplug your appliance as you will be working with electrical components. The door switch is typically located behind the door panel at the top of the door. You will need to separate the inner door from the outer door in order to access the switch. Once you have located it, remove the door switch in order to test it for continuity. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, test for continuity by touching one probe to the COM terminal and the other probe to the N.O. Terminal. With the actuator NOT pushed in, your reading should be infinity. Next, keeping the probes on the terminals, press in on the actuator until you hear a click, this should change the reading to zero. If the results of your test do not match the results above, you will need a replacement door switch. 
   - Will not dispense detergent
   - Causes
       -- Detergent & Rinse Aid Dispensers: The detergent dispenser is designed to release detergent into the dishwasher tub during the wash cycles and will typically have two compartments, an unsealed compartment for prewash and a sealed compartment for the main wash cycle. How to inspect a dishwasher dispenser: Disconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate your dispenser, you will not need to remove it to inspect it. It will most likely be found attached to the inside of the dishwasher door. Visually inspect the dispenser for any signs of cracking, discoloration, or damage. If you find any caked-on detergent or debris on the dispenser, thoroughly clean it with a wet cloth. If you find any of the above issues, you will need a replacement dispenser.
       -- Rinse Aid Cap: The rinse aid cap could be the reason why your dishwasher is not releasing rinse aid. The rinse aid cap could be loose and may just need to be refitted, but could also be warped or damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher. How to inspect a dishwasher rinse aid cap: This is a very simple inspection; no tools or disassembly will be needed. The rinse aid dispensing cap is located on the inner door panel of your dishwasher. Remove the cap from the door in order to inspect it. Looking for any signs of melting, warping, cracking, or discoloration, visually inspect the rinse aid cap. If you find any issues while performing the inspection above, you will need a replacement rinse aid cap.
       -- Door Spring & Hinge Pin: If your dishwasher is not dispensing detergent, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded and is held in the closed position by a catch. How to inspect the door spring & hinge pin in a dishwasher: No tools or disassembly will be required; this is a very simple inspection. The door spring & hinge pin will be found on the inside of the dishwasher door, on some models it may be covered by the detergent dispenser assembly. Remove any components covering it if applicable. Visually inspect the spring and pin to see if they are bent, broken, corroded, or otherwise damaged. If you find any issues with your spring and pin, you will need a replacement door spring & hinge pin.
       -- Wax Motor: The wax motor is used in newer model dishwashers to release the detergent dispenser door catch. If the wax motor is not working properly, then the dispenser door will not open to release the detergent. The wax motor acts as a solenoid when activated by the dishwasher's timer or control, and the piston operates the mechanism that will release the catch for the dispenser door. How to test a dishwasher wax motor with a multimeter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. Depending on your model, you will need to remove the external door panel or the internal door panel in order to access the wax motor, which will be located near the detergent dispenser cup. Remove the wax motor in order to test it. Using a multimeter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to one terminal each to test it. If you receive a reading of infinity, the motor is defective. If your motor fails the test above, you will need a replacement wax motor.
       -- Bi-Metal Release: Some older model dishwashers use a bi-metal release to operate the detergent dispenser door catch. The bi-metal release uses electric current to create a mechanical action to release the door catch.

Use caution when replacing a control board as sometimes the burned components are caused by external component failures. These will need to be identified and corrected before installing a new control board.
   - Will not agitate
   - Causes
       -- Agitator: In top loading washing machines, the agitator is responsible for moving the clothes through the water and detergent and is driven by the output shaft of the transmission. The output shaft is normally splined, and the center of the plastic agitator will have a matching spline to ensure a tight fit. Depending on the brand, the agitator may be a single piece unit or a two-piece dual action agitator. How to inspect the agitator in a washing machine: Disconnect your washing machine from the power source. Remove the fabric softener dispenser or top cover, depending on your model, in order to access the agitator. Attempt to manually turn the agitator. As it is splined, you should experience some resistance. Remove the agitator from the appliance to inspect it more closely.  Most agitators are held in place with a bolt that threads into the top of the transmission shaft. Some models use a small set screw in the barrel of the agitator just above the base to secure the agitator to the shaft, while some will use a rubber O-ring to provide a tight fit. If your agitator is worn or damaged on any part of it, particularly on the splines, or if you experience little to no resistance when turning it manually, you will need a replacement agitator.
       -- Agitator Directional Cogs: On top loading washers that use a dual action agitator, it is possible for the upper portion of the agitator to become disengaged from the bottom portion. The upper part is driven by directional cogs or "dogs" that are made of hard plastic and can wear out from hard use. If the upper portion of your agitator will turn in either direction or makes a grating sound during the wash cycle, then the directional cogs may need to be replaced. How to inspect the directional cogs in a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine and remove the fabric softener dispenser or top cover, depending on your model. Locate your agitator cogs. You may need to remove the agitator cap, top, or base, depending on your model, to access the cogs. Visually inspect the cogs for discoloration, wear, or damage. You should also look to see if any cogs are missing. If your cogs have any of the symptoms described above, you will need a set of replacement directional cogs.
       -- Agitator Coupler & Cap & Bolt: Some models of top loading washers use a coupler between the transmission shaft and the agitator. The drive coupler is splined on the inside to match the transmission and splined on the outside to match the agitator. If your washer is making a grinding noise during the wash cycle and the agitator turns freely then the drive coupling may be damaged. How to inspect the agitator coupler in a washing machine: Before beginning, disconnect your washer from the power source. In order to access the agitator coupler, you will first need to remove the fabric softener dispenser or top cover, depending on your model, and you will then need to remove the agitator. Remove the coupler from the appliance by unthreading the bolt securing it to the transmission shaft. Inspect the coupler for any signs of cracking, damage, burning, rust, or wear. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement agitator coupler.
       -- Direct Drive Motor Coupling: Some top load washers use a direct drive motor coupling to transfer power from the motor to the transmission. The drive coupling connects the motor to the transmission and consists of 2 plastic drive forks with a rubber coupling between them. One of the drive forks is attached to the drive motor shaft and the other is attached to the transmission input shaft. As the motor shaft rotates, the rubber coupling between the drive forks absorbs the torque to prevent the forks from breaking. Normal use will create wear on the coupling and eventually, the drive forks may slip and not engage the transmission and clutch. A common symptom of a failing motor coupling is that the washing machine fills and drains normally but will not agitate or spin. How to inspect the direct drive motor coupling in a washing machine: Before beginning, disconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate and remove the motor coupling to inspect it. To access it, you will need to open your washer's cabinet, and you may also need to remove the drain pump and/or motor depending on your model. Once you have removed it, inspect your coupling for any signs or damage, wear, or cracking. If you find any of the symptoms above, you will need a replacement direct drive motor coupling.
       -- Drive Belt: Some models of top loading washers use a belt to drive the transmission. If the washing machine stops agitating, then the belt may be at fault. How to tell if the drive belt in a washing machine needs replacing: After unplugging your washer, remove the cabinet or access panel in order to locate the drive belt. The drive belt will be connected to the drive motor and can be removed by disconnecting the clamps holding it in place. Visually inspect your drive belt. You are looking for signs of damage, wear, fraying, or burning. If your belt has any of the symptoms described above, you need a replacement drive belt.
       -- Transmission: The transmission in a top load washer is responsible for converting the rotating motion of the motor to the back and forth motion for the agitator. The transmission has an input shaft that is driven by the motor either directly or by a belt, as well as an output shaft to drive the agitator. If your agitator drive shaft does not oscillate then you should first, ensure that the input shaft is being driven. If the input shaft is turning but the agitator shaft does not turn, then the transmission is at fault. Most manufacturers do not supply internal parts and the complete transmission would be required. You should also be prepared to replace any tub seal that is located where the shaft enters the tub. How to inspect the transmission in a washing machine: Before conducting inspections on your transmission, first ensure that your issue is not stemming from the agitator or any of its components. If you have ruled out the agitator, unplug your washer, remove the cabinet, and locate your transmission. Once you have located the transmission, plug your washing machine back in and run a wash cycle to determine if the transmission is the source of the problem. A faulty transmission will make strange noises during operation. Use caution when performing this step as the internal components of your dryer are exposed. If the transmission is noisy during this test, you need a replacement transmission.
       -- Drive Motor: All top load washers use a motor to drive the transmission for agitating. Many washing machine brands use a reversing motor, which means the motor rotates in one direction for agitating and the opposite for spinning and draining. The motor may operate correctly in the spin direction but not in the agitation direction. How to test the drive motor in a washing machine: Disconnect the power source from your appliance before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Remove the cabinet of your washer in order to locate and remove the drive motor. You will need to disconnect the wires attached to the motor in order to remove it from the appliance, do this by pulling on the metal connectors and not the wires.

You should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero. If you do not receive this reading, you will need a replacement timer. 
       -- Lid Switch: A safety feature found in top load washing machines is the lid switch. The lid switch is normally located beneath the main top and is in series with the motor circuit and must be activated for the motor to operate. When the lid is closed a pin or projection on the lid pushes against the lid switch lever and closes the switch. If your washer does not agitate and the motor is not getting any power, you should check the lid switch. How to inspect the lid switch in a washing machine: Begin by unplugging your washing machine, and then remove the top panel or cabinet. Locate the switch and verify that it is being activated when the lid is closed. If it is, remove the switch in order to test it. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to the terminals, and press and hold the switch button down. The multi-meter should show a reading zero or nearly zero. If your test produces different results, you will need a replacement lid switch.
       -- Selector Switch: The selector switch is used on some models to control the drive motor speed. If the switch is defective it may stop the motor from operating. How to test the selector switch in a washing machine with a multi-meter: Unplug your washing machine before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove the selector switch from your appliance. It likely will be secured to the frame of the washing machine. You will need to remove all or part of your washer's cabinet to access it. Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, you are going to test one button at a time for continuity. Touch the probes to the terminals and press in on the first button, the reading should change from infinity to zero. Keeping the probes connected to the terminals, press in on another button, the reading should go back to infinity. If your test results differ from those above, you will need a replacement selector switch. 
       -- Water Level Switch: The water level switch on a top load washer is used to select the correct water level. The switch is also used to supply power to the drive motor. When the correct water level is reached, the switch will remove power from the water inlet valve and supply power to the drive motor circuit. If your washer fills but does not agitate then the pressure switch may be at fault. How to test the water level switch in a washing machine: Disconnect your washing machine from the power source. The water level switch is usually found behind the control panel but can also be found at the sump area below the tubs. Before replacing the switch, first eliminate the air dome hose as the problem. Remove the hose and submerge it in water, seal one end, blow air into the other and look for bubbles. You should also check for obstructions in the hose and look for signs of cracks or wearing. If no issues are found with the air dome hose, you may need a replacement water level switch.
   - Shakes and moves
   - Causes
       -- Shock Absorber: All front-load washing machines have shock absorbers that are used to dampen the tub movement in the spin cycle. The shock absorbers or struts are attached to the base frame and to the outer tub and you will need to remove the front panel or the rear panel to access them. When shock absorbers weaken or become damaged, unbalanced loads will cause the washer to shake or move and the machine will often make a loud banging sound during the spin cycle. If the symptom is not corrected, it can lead to damage to other components.  How to inspect the shock absorbers on a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine before beginning. Locate the shock absorbers. Depending on your model, you will need to remove the front or rear panel to access it. Looking for signs of broken attachments, weakened dampening action, or leaking fluids, inspect the shock absorbers. If you find signs of the symptoms above, you will need replacement shock absorbers. You should replace both shocks at the same time, even if only one shows the signs above as they wear at approximately the same rate.
       -- Suspension Spring & Tub Spring: The suspension springs on your washing machine are used to either suspend the tub assembly from the cabinet or to stabilize the tub assembly to the washer base. They also absorb the vibration of the wash basket while the machine is in the spin cycle. Occasionally these springs will become damaged, stretched or detached which can cause excessive noise and vibration from your washer during the spin cycle. How to inspect the suspension spring in a washing machine: Disconnect the power supply from your appliance before starting. Remove the top or front panel of the washing machine to gain access to the suspension springs. Inspect for stretching or damage and ensure that they are securely attached at both ends. Use caution when replacing the springs as they are under tension and always wear the proper protective clothing. If you find any signs of damage, stretching, or wear, you will need replacement suspension springs. We recommend that you replace all the suspension springs at the same time if any are determined to be defective as they wear at approximately the same rate..
       -- Snubber Ring & Damper Pad & Tub Wear Pads: Some washing machines have a snubber ring that helps dampen vibration from your washing machine during the spin cycle. It is normally located at the bottom of the machine and provides a cushion between the base and the tub support assembly. The snubber ring/tub wear pads are often made of hard plastic, although some damper pads are made of lubricated felt. Both styles will wear with normal use and eventually can allow the tub to move excessively. In extreme conditions, they can wear to the point where the metal base contacts the metal tub support and the washer will shake uncontrollably. How to inspect the damper pad in a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine and remove the front panel. Locate and inspect the snubber. You will need to remove the tub springs in order to inspect the snubber. On the plastic style snubber, look for signs of white dust on or near the snubber. On the felt style, look for dislodged or dry pads. If you find either of the symptoms above, you will need a replacement snubber ring.
       -- Tub Dampening Strap: Some models of top-load washers use tub dampening straps to cushion the movement of the tub during the spin cycle. There are four straps attached to the top of the tub and to each corner of the cabinet. These straps are made of rubber and can fail with normal use. When the straps become stretched or damaged, the tub may contact the cabinet during the spin cycle, causing the washer to shake or move and creating a loud banging sound. Continuous large loads and excessive use will create more strain and cause premature failure of the straps. How to inspect the tub dampening strap in a washing machine: Begin by unplugging your washing machine, and then open the cabinet of your washer to locate the tub dampening straps. There will be four straps, each connected to the wash tub and a corner of the cabinet. Looking for signs of fraying, damage, or wear, inspect the tub dampening straps. If you find any of the above symptoms on one of your straps, you will need four replacement tub dampening straps. We recommend that you replace all four straps at the same time as they wear at approximately the same rate.
       -- Leveling Leg: The leveling legs on a washing machine are used to support the washer and are adjustable so that the machine can be leveled. Some models use four threaded legs and others use two threaded legs and two self-leveling rear legs. If your washer is shaking or vibrating during the spin cycle you should first verify that the machine is level and sitting firmly on all four legs. How to inspect the levelling legs of a washing machine: While this repair does not involve dismantling, we recommend unplugging your appliance before beginning. Tilt your washing machine on its front, side, or back in order to have access to the feet. Begin by ensuring that all the leveling feet are level. If you find one or more are not, run a test cycle to see if the problem has been resolved. If not, inspect the feet for any signs of wear or damage, and to ensure they are threaded properly. If you find any of the issues above, you will need replacement leveling legs.
   - Burning smell
   - Causes
       -- Drive Belt Or Spin Belt: Some models of top loading washers use a belt to drive the transmission. If the washing machine stops agitating, then the belt may be at fault. How to tell if the drive belt in a washing machine needs replacing: Disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. To remove the drive belt, you will need to remove the clamps that are holding it in place. The drive belt will be found attached to the drive motor. You will need to remove the rear panel or cabinet to access it. Once you have removed it, inspect the belt for signs of fraying, cracking, burning, or any other damage. If you find any issues with your belt, you need a replacement drive belt.
       -- Pump Belt: Some top load washers use a belt to operate the drain pump. This belt is normally a standard V-shaped belt that is coupled from the drive motor to a pulley on the drain pump. There may also be an idler pulley assembly to provide tension on the belt. If you experience a burning rubber smell from your washer, you should inspect the pump belt. How to tell if the pump belt in a washing machine needs replacing: Disconnect your washer from the power source and open your washer's cabinet. Locate and remove the pump belt in order to inspect it. It will be attached to the drive motor pulley, and to remove it you will need to remove the clamps holding it in place. Looking for any signs of burning, wear, fraying, or damage, visually inspect your pump. If your belt shows any of the symptoms above, you will need a replacement pump belt.
       -- Motor Pulley: The drive motor uses a pulley to turn the drive and/or pump belts. The motor pulley is designed to provide the maximum contact with the belts and may be made of metal or a synthetic material. If the pulley becomes worn or rusted, it may create excess friction and overheat or damage the belt, causing a burning smell. How to inspect the motor pulley on a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine before starting this inspection. Locate and remove the motor pulley in order to closely inspect it. You will need to remove the cabinet to do so, as well as removing any belts attached to the motor pulley. Visually inspect your motor pulley for any buildups of grease, dirt, or other materials, as well as for signs of damage, wear, or burning.  If you find that your pulley is worn or damage, you will need a replacement pulley.
       -- Drain Pump: The drain pump on a washing machine is used to pump the water from the wash tub before and during the spin cycle. The pump may be belt driven, motor driven or have its own electric motor. A burning smell coming from the washing machine during or after the spin cycle can indicate that the drain pump has become seized, preventing it from turning. On belt driven models, the burning smell normally emanates from the belt slipping on the pump pulley. On models that use an electric drain pump, the smell would be related to the pump motor, and may be more of an electrical motor smell. How to inspect drain pump the in a washing machine: Disconnect the power source from your appliance and then remove the front panel or cabinet. Once you have located the pump, begin by inspecting all the connections and hoses coming off the pump to determine if it is the source of the leak. If any issues are found, replace that connector or hose. If the leak is coming from the pump itself, you will need a replacement pump.
       -- Idler Pulley Wheel & Idler Pulley Arm: Some models of top load washers utilize an idler pulley assembly to provide tension on the drive or pump belt. If the idler pulley becomes seized or if the idler arm does not pivot freely, then proper tension on the belt cannot be achieved and excess belt slippage or friction will occur and cause the belt to overheat and create a burning smell. How to inspect a washing machine's idler pulley wheel and arm: Verify that you have disconnected your washer from the power source before beginning, and then open your washer's cabinet. Locate and inspect your idler pulley wheel and arm. You are looking for any signs of damage, wear, cracking, or burning. The drive belt will be attached to the pulley and you will need to disconnect it in order to inspect the pulley. To remove the belt, tilt the idler pulley towards the drum to decrease the tension on the belt enough to slip it off. Inspect the pulley wheel to ensure that it turns smoothly with minimal resistance and does not wobble. If you find any issues when performing the checks above, you will need a replacement idler pulley wheel or arm.
       -- Direct Drive Motor Coupling: Some top load washers use a direct drive motor coupling instead of a belt, to transfer power from the motor to the transmission. The drive coupling connects the motor to the transmission and consists of 2 plastic drive forks with a rubber coupling between them. One of the drive forks is attached to the drive motor shaft and the other is attached to the transmission input shaft. As the motor shaft rotates, the rubber coupling between the drive forks absorbs the torque to prevent the forks from breaking. Normal use will create wear on the coupling and eventually, the drive forks may slip and cause a burning smell. How to inspect the direct drive motor coupling in a washing machine: Similar to many other inspections, begin by verifying that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source. You will need to remove the coupling from your washer in order to closely inspect it. To access it you will need to remove all or part of your washer's cabinet and depending on your model you may also need to remove the drain pump and/or the motor. Visually inspect your motor coupling for cracking, damage, wear, or burning If you find any issues with your motor coupling, you will need a replacement direct drive motor coupling.	 
       -- Clutch Assembly: Some models of top load washers use a clutch assembly to drive the wash basket during the spin cycle. A burning smell in your washing machine can be a result of a worn clutch, and your machine will likely be making a loud scraping noise during the spin cycle. Another common sign of a worn clutch is brake dust or shavings found underneath the washing machine. How to inspect the clutch assembly in a washing machine: After disconnecting the appliance from the power source, open your washer's cabinet in order to locate the clutch assembly. To closely inspect the clutch assembly, you should remove it from the appliance. It will usually be found below the outer tub, attached to the basket drive assembly. Depending on your model, you may need to remove the drive motor and/or transmission to access it. Inspect your clutch assembly for any signs of damage, burning, fraying, or wear. If you find any of the above symptoms, you will need a replacement clutch assembly.
       -- Glide & Spring: Some models of washing machines use a spring and glide arrangement on the drive motor for belt tensioning. Typically, the drive motor will have a pivot mount to the base frame and a spring to provide the tension. A lubricated plastic or nylon glide is attached to the bottom of the motor to allow it to slide on the washer base frame. This will allow the drive belt and/or pump belt to slip a little when the motor starts and acts like a clutch. If the glide does not slide freely then the belts can become overheated and create a burning smell. How to inspect the glide and spring on a washing machine. Unplug your washing machine before beginning. Remove the front panel of the washer in order to locate the glide(s) and spring(s). The drive motor spring and glides are normally located on top of the base frame and can be found by removing the front panel. Verify that the motor pivots properly, that the springs are not stretched and that the surface is free of any dirt or rust. Inspect the glide(s) for any signs of burning, wear, or damage, lubricating them if needed. If you find any issues or broken parts while performing these checks, you may need replacement glides and springs.
       -- Drive Motor: In most washers, the main drive motor is used to operate the mechanical functions of the wash cycles such as agitation or tumble and spin. It may also be used to operate the drain pump. When a defect or problem occurs in one of the motor-driven components it may cause the drive motor to overheat and create a burning smell. If the problem is severe, it may also overheat the motor enough to cause it to fail. A common symptom associated with a failing drive motor is a humming or buzzing noise when the motor is starting. How to test the drive motor in a washing machine: After verifying that you unplugged your washer, remove the cabinet of your appliance. Remove the drive motor to test it. There will be multiple wires attached to it, remove them by pulling on the metal connectors and not the wires themselves. You will be testing the motor for continuity as well as testing the ground connection. Your multi-meter should be set to Rx1 for both tests. To test for continuity, touch the probes to the terminals of the motor. This should produce a reading of nearly or exactly zero. To test for the ground connection, keep one probe on the terminal and touch the other to the bare metal housing, you shouldn't receive any reading from this test. If your multi-meter readings do not match those above, you need a replacement drive motor.
   - Lid or door will not open
   - Causes
       -- Door Lock Or Interlock: The door lock, also known as the interlock, is a safety mechanism used on front load washing machines and on some top load washers that prevents the door or lid from being opened while the machine is in operation. The system consists of a door mounted catch and a door lock mechanism located on the back of the front panel/door shroud or main top. The lock mechanism consists of some switches and normally a lock/unlock solenoid or wax motor solenoid. When the cycle is started, the washer control will activate the lock solenoid/wax motor to prevent the door or lid from being opened. At the conclusion of the cycle, the control will activate the door unlock solenoid or will deactivate the door lock wax motor. The wax motor style of solenoid normally takes at least a minute or two to activate or deactivate. If the door or lid won't open at the end of the cycle, then the lock mechanism may be at fault. Most washers will have a manual release to unlock the mechanism and allow you to open the door or lid. The release is normally accessible from below the door lock, or on some models, from inside the soap dispenser housing. How to inspect the door lock in a washing machine: Disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. Locate and clean your door lock to remove any films or debris that may have built up. It is usually located along the frame of the washing machine, under the lid. If cleaning it does not resolve the issue, remove the door lock from the appliance to inspect it for damage, cracking or wear. You likely will need to remove all or part of the washer's cabinet to remove the switch. If you find your switch shows any of the symptoms above, you will need a replacement door lock.
       -- Door Strike & Catch & Hook: The door strike, also known as the catch or hook, is part of a safety mechanism installed on front-loading washing machines or used to activate the lid switch on a top load washer. On front load washers, the door hook is used to engage the lock mechanism. If the door hook becomes damaged, it may not properly activate the door lock assembly, or it may not disengage easily from the lock mechanism at the end of the cycle. The door strike or hook is normally made of rigid plastic and can break with normal use and abuse, or if someone has attempted to open the door with force while the lock is engaged. How to inspect the door strike on a washing machine: This is a simple inspection; no tools or disassembly is required. Locate your door strike. It will be found in the door frame of your washing machine. Visually inspect the strike to ensure it engages with the door lock assembly properly and releases without issue. Additionally, inspect the strike for any signs of wear, cracking, or damage. If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need a replacement door strike.
       -- Lid Hinge & Pin: On standard top-load washing machines, there will be two hinges that attach the lid to the main top. These hinges may be made from metal or plastic and will eventually show signs of wear from normal use. If you have difficulty opening the lid, then the hinges may be at fault. How to inspect the lid hinge & pin on a washing machine: As you will be exposing electrical components as a part of this inspection, ensure that you unplug your washer before beginning. Begin by lifting the lid and inspecting the lid hinges and pins for any signs of cracking, wear, damage, or any dirt that may be clogging the hinges. Lift or remove the main top in order to inspect all sides of the hinges and pins. If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need replacement lid hinges.
   - Will not stop filling with water
   - Causes
       -- Water Inlet valve: The Water Inlet Valve on your washing machine is used to fill the tub with cold, warm or hot water for the wash and rinse cycles. The valve is operated by electric solenoids that are controlled by the timer or electronic control board and the water level control/water level selector switch or pressure switch. If your washer continues to fill during a cycle, the water inlet valve could be at fault. To verify that the valve is at fault, unplug the washer when the symptom occurs. If the washer continues to fill, then the water inlet valve is defective. If the washer stops filling, then the problem is related to the electrical circuit that controls the valve. How to test the water inlet valve in a washing machine with a multi-meter: Similar to other tests, ensure that you have disconnected the power source from your appliance before beginning, as you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove your water inlet valve. It is most often found directly behind the hose connections; you will need to remove the rear panel in order to access it. Visually inspect the valve for any signs of wear or damage. The valve has screens inside it, inspect these screens for any debris, do this carefully as these screens cannot be replaced and if they get damaged you will need to replace the entire valve. With a multi-meter on Rx1, touch the probes to the valve's terminals. The reading you should receive varies from model to model, refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your valve is damaged or if your test results do not match the recommended results, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.
       -- Water Level Switch & Pressure Switch & Air Dome Tube: The water level switch is a pressure activated switch that is used to determine the correct water level in the tub. This part is normally located behind the control panel and will have a hose or air dome tube that connects it to the tub. On washers that use an electronic control, this switch may be located at the sump area below the tub. As the water fills in the tub it will compress the air in the tube and push against a diaphragm inside the switch. The switch will control the water inlet valve and turn the valve off at the correct water level. If the tube has a leak or is plugged, not enough pressure may be created to activate the switch and the washer may overfill. If the switch is defective it may also cause the machine to overfill. How to test the water level switch in a washing machine: Because you will be handling electrical components, ensure that you have disconnected your washer from the power source before beginning. Open your washer's cabinet in order to locate and remove the water level switch and the air dome tube. Once removed, plug one end of the air dome tube, submerge it in water, and blow into the other end. An undamaged hose will not have any bubbles coming out of it. Inspect the hose and the valve for any signs of cracking, wear, or damage. If any issues are found when performing the checks above, you may need a replacement water level switch.
   - Pumps but does not spin
   - Causes
       -- Direct Drive Motor Coupling: Some top load washers use a direct drive motor coupling to transfer power from the motor to the transmission. The drive coupling connects the motor to the transmission and consists of two plastic drive forks with a rubber coupling between them. One of the drive forks is attached to the drive motor shaft and the other is attached to the transmission input shaft. As the motor shaft rotates, the rubber coupling between the drive forks absorbs the torque to prevent the forks from breaking. Normal use will create wear on the coupling and eventually, the drive forks may slip and not engage the transmission and clutch. A common symptom of a failing motor coupling is that the washing machine fills and drains normally but will not agitate or spin. How to inspect the direct drive motor coupling in a washing machine: You will be handling electrical components during these checks; ensure you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning. Locate the motor coupling, you will need to open your washer's cabinet, and depending on your model, you may also need to remove the motor and/or drain pump to access it. Remove the motor coupling and inspect it for any signs of cracking, wear, or damage. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement direct drive motor coupling.
       -- Door Lock & Interlock: The door lock, also known as the interlock, is a safety mechanism installed on front-loading washing machines, and some top load washers, which prevents the door from being opened while the machine is in operation. The system consists of the locking mechanism on the machine and the door strike on the door. The locking mechanism also contains a switch that will indicate to the control board or timer, when the door is locked and therefore allow a spin cycle to operate. When the door lock fails, it may not lock the door, or the door lock switch might not engage and therefore not recognize that the door is locked and not allow the washer to agitate or spin. Some modern washers with a digital display may show a fault code as well. If your washing machine is displaying any of these symptoms or a door lock fault code has been confirmed, the door lock may need to be replaced. How to inspect the door lock on a washing machine:  Unplug the appliance before beginning. The door lock is usually found along the frame of the washing machine, under the lid. Begin by cleaning the area to remove any films that may have developed. If this does not resolve the issue, remove the door lock to inspect it for any signs of wear, damage, or cracking. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement door lock.
       -- Wax Motor: Some front load washing machines use wax motors to engage the door lock assembly. When a cycle is started, an electrical current is supplied to the wax motor, pushing a pin outward and locking the door. When the wax motor fails, the door lock will not engage and will not allow the machine to spin. How to test a washing machine wax motor with a multi-meter: Disconnect your washing machine from the power supply before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove your wax motor. You will need to remove all or part of the cabinet to access it, it will likely be found near the door lock mechanism. With a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to the motor's terminals to test it. You should receive a reading of 1500 to 1900 ohms. If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement wax motor.
       -- Lid Switch: The lid switch on a top load washing machine is used as a safety device to prevent the motor circuit from operating when the lid is open. If the lid switch fails, the washer may not spin. The lid switch is normally located beneath the main top with a projection on the lid or a pin attached to the lid that will actuate the switch when the lid is closed. Verify that the switch is being activated mechanically and that any levers or actuators are not damaged or sticking. If the switch is being activated but there is no power being supplied to the motor, then the switch may be defective. How to test the lid switch in a washing machine with a multi-meter: Because you will be handling electrical components, ensure that you have unplugged your appliance before beginning. Locate the lid switch on your appliance. Remove any parts of the cabinet you need to in order to have full access to the switch. Verify that the switch is being operated mechanically, you should also inspect the levers and actuators to ensure they are not damaged or sticking. If it is being operated mechanically and no issues were found with the levers or actuators, remove the switch from the appliance, set your multi-meter to Rx1, and touch the probes to the terminals. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of zero. If your test results do not match those above, you will need a replacement lid switch.
       -- Clutch Assembly: Some top load washers use a clutch assembly to lock the transmission input shaft to the wash basket drive during the spin cycle. Over time, the repeated friction of the clutch pads rubbing against the housing can cause the clutch to wear and create a scraping sound. A worn clutch can prevent your washing machine from spinning or may cause a slower spin speed which will leave your clothes wet after a cycle. Additional symptoms that the clutch may be causing your problems are brake dust or shavings found underneath the washing machine, a slight burning smell or a loud noise during the spin cycle. How to inspect the clutch assembly in a washing machine: Disconnect the washer from the power source. The clutch assembly is usually found attached to the basket drive assembly, below the outer tub. Remove the clutch assembly in order to inspect it. You may need to remove the cabinet, drive motor, and/or transmission to access the clutch, depending on your model. Looking for any signs of burning, damage, or wear, visually inspect your clutch assembly. If you find any issues while inspecting it, you will need a replacement clutch assembly.
       -- Drive Belt or Spin Belt: The drive belt is used to connect the drive motor to the transmission in some top load washers, or the drive motor to the wash basket in most front load washers. If your washer does not spin you should inspect the drive belt for signs of overheating or excessive wear. Before replacing a damaged belt, you should verify that any belt tensioning device such as an idler pulley or motor glide is operating properly and moves freely. On top load washers, you should also verify that the transmission pulley turns freely in both the spin and agitate directions and that there is nothing impeding the movement of the agitator or the wash basket that may cause the belt to slip on the pulleys. You should also check for signs of oil or water leakage onto the belt or pulley area. On front load washers, make sure that the tub will turn easily by hand. How to tell if the drive belt in a washing machine needs replacing: Before beginning, unplug your washing machine and then remove the cabinet/access panel. Find and remove the drive belt. To remove it, disconnect the clamps holding it in place, it will be connected to the drive motor. Looking for any signs of fraying, burning, wear, or damage, visually inspect your drive belt. If you find any of the symptoms above, you need a replacement drive belt.
   - Noisy
   - Causes
       -- Pump & Pump Motor: The drain pump on a washing machine is used to pump the water from the wash tub before and during the spin cycle. The pump may be belt driven, motor driven or have its own electric motor. A noise coming from the washing machine during or after the spin cycle can indicate that the drain pump has a restriction or has become defective. How to inspect the pump & pump motor on a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine and remove the front panel or cabinet to locate the pump. Plug your washer back in and run a cycle to verify that the pump is the source of the noise. Use caution as you are now exposed to moving parts and electrical circuits. If you can confirm that the noise is emanating from the pump, remove the inlet hose to the pump. Inspect the pump impeller for signs of foreign objects that may be causing the noise or for damage to the impeller. You should also attempt to turn the impeller manually to verify that it is not seized or worn. Remove any foreign objects you may find around the pump. If you find any signs of wear or damage, or if the impeller is seized, you need a replacement pump motor. Front load washers often use a self-contained electric drain pump and the motor may be worn or damaged and require a complete replacement pump.
       -- Drive Belt: The drive belt is used to connect the drive motor to the transmission in some top load washers, or the drive motor to the wash basket in most front load washers. The drive belt is used to connect the drive motor to the transmission in some top load washers, or the drive motor to the wash basket in most front load washers. The drive belt may be either a single V-shaped belt or a multi-rib belt and is normally made of rubber but may have a fabric covering. On front load washers the drive belt is normally a multi-ribbed belt and is designed to be installed for a tight fit. On belt driven top load washers, the drive belt is normally a V belt with a fabric covering to allow for some slippage or it may be a rubber covered belt with an idler pulley or another tensioning device to reduce the amount of friction created when the motor starts up. How to tell if a washing machine drive belt needs replacing: Disconnect your washer from the power source, and then remove the access panel or cabinet. Locate your drive belt, it will be connected to the drive motor on one end. Once you have located it, remove the clamps that hold the belt in place and remove the belt in order to inspect it. Inspect the drive belt for any signs of burning, fraying, wear, or any other damage. If you find any of the above, you need a replacement drive belt. 
       -- Direct Drive Motor Coupling: Some top load washers use a direct drive motor coupling to transfer power from the motor to the transmission. The drive coupling connects the motor to the transmission and consists of two plastic drive forks with a rubber coupling between them. One of the drive forks is attached to the drive motor shaft and the other is attached to the transmission input shaft. As the motor shaft rotates, the rubber coupling between the drive forks absorbs the torque to prevent the forks from breaking. Normal use will create wear on the coupling and eventually the drive forks may slip and cause a vibrating noise. If the transmission seizes or if the spin basket cannot turn freely, then the coupling may fail and again you may experience a vibrating noise. How to inspect a washing machine's direct drive motor coupling: Unplug your washing machine. Open your washer's cabinet in order to locate and remove the direct drive motor coupling. You may need to remove the drain pump and/or motor to access the motor coupling, depending on your model. Inspect the motor coupling for any signs of cracking, wear, or damage. If you find any of these, you will need a replacement direct drive motor coupling. 
       -- Shock Absorbers: All front-load washing machines have shock absorbers that are used to dampen the tub movement in the spin cycle. The shock absorbers or struts are attached to the base frame and to the outer tub and you will need to remove the front panel or the rear panel to access them. When shock absorbers weaken or become damaged, the machine will often make a loud banging sound during the spin cycle and if the symptom is not corrected, can lead to damage of other components.  How to inspect the shock absorbers on a washing machine: Disconnect your appliance from the power source. Remove the front or rear panel, depending on your model, in order to locate the shock absorbers. Inspect the shocks for signs of broken attachments, leaked fluids, or a weakened dampening action. If either shock shows any of the signs above, you will need replacement shock absorbers. You should replace both shocks at the same time, even if only one shows the signs above as they wear at approximately the same rate.
       -- Tub Dampening Strap: Some models of top-load washers use tub dampening straps to cushion the movement of the tub during the spin cycle. There are four straps attached to the top of the tub and to each corner of the cabinet. These straps are made of rubber and can fail with normal use. When the straps become stretched or damaged, the tub may contact the cabinet during the spin cycle and create a loud banging sound. Continuous large loads and excessive use will create more strain and cause premature failure of the straps. How to inspect the tub dampening strap on your washing machine: After disconnecting your appliance from the power source, open the cabinet of your washer. Locate your tub dampening straps, there will be four of them, each one attached to the wash tub and a corner of the cabinet. Inspect the straps for any signs of wear, fraying, or damage. If any of the straps show the signs above, you will need four replacement tub dampening straps. It is recommended that you replace all four straps at the same time as they wear at approximately the same rate.
       -- Drive motor: The main drive motor on a top load washer is used to operate the transmission, spin the wash basket and on some washers, to operate the pump as well. On front load washers, the drive motor operates a belt that drives the wash basket pulley. A common symptom associated with a failing drive motor is a humming or buzzing noise when the motor starts, sometimes accompanied by a slight burning smell. The drive motor has a thermal overload that will remove power from the windings when it senses this overcurrent condition, and the motor will shut down. This could be caused by a driven component of the motor that has seized or by a defect in the motor itself. How to test a washing machine drive motor with a multi-meter: Ensure you unplug your appliance before starting; you will be handling electrical components. Remove the cabinet of your washer and locate the drive motor. Once you have located it, carefully disconnect the wires attached to it and remove it from the washer in order to test it. With your multi-meter set to Rx1, test for continuity by placing the probes on one terminal each. You should receive a reading of zero or close to zero. To test for ground connection, with one probe still touching a terminal touch the other probe to the bare metal housing of the motor. You should not receive any reading from this test. If your test results differ from those described above, you need a replacement drive motor.
       -- Drive Motor Pulley &Transmission Pulley & Pump Pulley: On belt driven washing machines, the motor pulley supports the drive belt and in some cases the pump belt. There will also be corresponding pulleys on the transmission and the pump. These pulleys can accumulate a buildup of grease, rubber compound or dirt that can cause a squealing or thumping sound when the motor is running. If your washer is making this type of sound when agitating, draining or spinning, then you should inspect the pulleys for signs of dirt accumulation or damage. How to check the pulleys on your washing machine: Before beginning, disconnect your appliance from the power source. Remove the cabinet and locate the pulley in question. Remove the belt from the pulley in order to closely inspect the pulley. Look for signs of burning, wear, or damage. You should also look for buildups of grease, dirt, or other materials, cleaning anything you find off the pulley and the surrounding area. If you find any signs of damage, you will need a replacement pulley.
       -- Pump Belt: On belt driven top load washers, the pump belt is what drives the pulley on the drain pump. Regular use and age can cause the pump belt to become cracked or frayed, which can create a squealing or thumping noise during the drain or spin cycle. This may be accompanied by a burning rubber smell or an incomplete drain as well. How to tell if the pump belt in a washing machine needs replacing: After unplugging your appliance, open the washer's cabinet in order to locate the pump belt. It will be connected to the drive motor pulley one on end. Remove the clamps that hold the belt in place in order to closely inspect it. You are looking for signs of damage, wear, fraying, and burning. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement pump belt.
       -- Tub Bearing: Both top and front-load washing machines have tub bearings that allow the wash basket or inner tub to rotate freely. Top load washers normally have a bearing at the bottom or input of the transmission and another where the shaft attaches to the inner tub. Front load washers typically use two bearings to support the wash basket shaft and are located at the rear of the outer tub. The bearings are protected from the wash water by a tub seal. Regular use, prolonged exposure to harsh detergents and overload conditions can cause the bearing seal to break down, allowing water to reach the bearings and eventually causing them to fail. How to inspect the tub bearing in a washing machine: Disconnect your washer from the power source. Remove the washer's cabinet and locate the tub bearing. Depending on the style and model of washer you have, you may need to remove the inner tub, wash basket, and/or transmission to access the tub bearing. Inspect the tub bearing for any signs of cracking, rust, wear, water damage, or other sign that the bearings have failed. If you find any of the symptoms above, you will need a replacement tub bearing. It is recommended that you replace your tub seal at the same time, especially if your bearing shows signs of rust or water damage.
       -- Agitator Directional Cogs & Dogs: Agitator directional cogs, sometimes referred to as agitator dogs, are often used to operate the upper portion of dual action agitators. These cam shaped dogs engage the cogs on the inner surface of the agitator as it turns in one direction, and then release when the agitator reverses direction. This allows the upper portion of the agitator to “ratchet" in one direction while the bottom half will agitate in both directions. The directional cogs are made of hard plastic and will wear with normal use. When they become too smooth to properly engage the cogs on the agitator, they will start slipping and will make a grinding or crunching noise. You will also notice that the top portion of the agitator does not move smoothly or doesn't move at all. How to inspect the agitator cogs in a washing machine: As with any other inspection, disconnect your washer from the power source before beginning. Open the lid of your washing machine, if your machine has a fabric softener dispenser, remove it to access the cogs. If your model does not have a fabric softener dispenser, remove the agitator cap to access the cogs. You may also need to remove the agitator top and/or base in order to access the cogs, depending on your model. Inspect the cogs for any signs of damage, wear, discoloration, and to see if there are any missing cogs. If you find any of the above, you will need a set of replacement directional cogs.
       -- Clutch Assembly: Some top load washers use a clutch assembly to lock the transmission input shaft to the wash basket drive during the spin cycle. Over time, the repeated friction of the clutch pads rubbing against the housing can cause the clutch to wear and create a scraping sound. A worn clutch can prevent your washing machine from spinning or may cause a slower spin speed which will leave your clothes wet after a cycle. Additional symptoms that the clutch may be causing your problems are brake dust or shavings found underneath the washing machine, a slight burning smell or a loud noise during the spin cycle. How to inspect the clutch assembly in a washing machine:  Unplug your appliance before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove your clutch assembly for close inspection. The clutch assembly is typically located below the outer tub and attached to the basket drive assembly. You will need to remove the cabinet, the drive motor, and transmission assembly to gain access to the clutch. Visually inspect the clutch assembly for any signs of wear, damage, or burning. If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement clutch assembly.

       -- Water Level Control: The water level control on washing machines is used to turn the water valve on and off at the selected levels, as well as to supply power to the timer motor when the correct water level is reached. If your washer fills but the timer does not advance you may have a defective water level switch. How to inspect the water level control in a washing machine: Before beginning, unplug your washing machine as you will be handling electrical components. Prior to suspecting the switch, you should eliminate the air dome hose as the source of the problem. Remove the cabinet to locate and remove the air dome hose. Submerge the hose in water, seal one end while blowing air into the other, looking for bubbles throughout. Additionally, you should check the hose for signs of cracks, wearing, or obstructions. If no issues are found above, you may need a replacement water level switch.
       -- Timer Knob & Dial & Skirt: The timer knob or dial is attached to the timer shaft and will turn as the timer advances through a cycle. The timer knob may also be used to start the cycle by pulling out on the knob which activates a switch inside the timer. The timer knob is normally made of plastic, strengthened with a keyed metal insert where it attaches to the timer shaft. Normal use can cause the knob to crack or wear and no longer turn with the timer shaft. This will make it difficult to turn the timer to the desired cycle and will also cause the dial to not turn with the timer shaft as the cycle advances. How to inspect the timer knob in a washing machine: Disconnect your washer from the power source.  Locate the timer knob, you will need to remove the rear panel or cabinet to access the back of the timer. Inspect the knob to ensure that the timer engages when the knob is pulled out and pushed in. If it does not engage, you will need replacement knobs. 
       -- Drain Pump: The drain pump removes water from the washing machine tub at the end of the wash and rinse portions of the cycle. If the drain pump fails, then the washer will not sense that the tub is empty and may not advance into the next portion of the cycle. If your washer stalls at the end of the wash or rinse portions of the cycle, you should check to see if the drain pump is functioning properly. Some electronically controlled models may display a fault code if this condition occurs. If your machine is flashing a fault code, you can refer to our list of common appliance fault codes to determine the source. How to inspect drain pump the in a washing machine: Unplug your washing machine. Locate your drain pump. You will have to remove the front panel or cabinet of your appliance to access the pump. Once you have found the pump, inspect all the hoses and connections coming off the pump for leaks or damage. If the leak is coming from the pump, you will need a replacement pump.
       -- Water Inlet Valve: The water inlet valve is used to supply both hot and cold water to the washer during the fill portions of the cycle. The valve will have at least two electric solenoids that open the valve when required. If your washer does not advance through the cycle or stalls at a wash or rinse fill portion, then the water inlet valve may be at fault. You should first verify that the inlet hoses do not have any kinks or restrictions and that the inlet screens are clean. If these are ok, then you can check the continuity of the solenoids with a multi-meter. How to test the water inlet valve in a washing machine with a multi-meter: Ensure that you have unplugged the washing machine before starting. Locate and remove the water inlet valve. It will likely be found directly behind the hose connections; you will need to remove all or part of the cabinet to access it. Inspect the screens inside the valve for debris or buildups, do this carefully as the screens cannot be replaced and if they are damaged you will need a new valve. Visually inspect your pump for any signs of wear or damage, if none are found, set your multi-meter to Rx1 and place the probes on to the terminals. Refer to your owner's manual to see what reading this test should produce, as it varies from model to model. If your reading is outside the recommended range, if you receive a reading of infinity, or if your valve is visibly damaged, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.
Appliance: Dryer
Symptoms:
   - Timer will not advance
   - Causes
       -- Timer Motor: Located in the control console of the dryer the timer consists of a small motor connected to a series of gears that rotate cams, which turn electric contacts off and on inside the timer. The timer contacts control the dryer motor as well as the heat circuit and the timer motor itself. A defective timer motor or a defect in the timer's electrical contacts can cause the timer motor to fail and the timer will need to be replaced.   How to test a dryer's timer motor with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source and remove the control console.  Locate the timer. In some models, you will be able to remove it for testing at this stage, in other models, you will also need to remove the rear panel behind the control console.  Set your multi-meter to Rx1 and place the probes on the terminals. You are testing for continuity and should have a reading between 2000 & 3000 ohms.  If your test returns a reading outside of this range, you need a replacement timer motor.  
       -- Cycling Thermostat: On gas and electric dryers that have an "Auto Dry" cycle, the cycling thermostat is often used to advance the timer as well regulate the drum temperature. Essentially, the thermostat will alternately turn on the heat source or the timer motor when the temperature has been satisfied.   How to test a dryer cycling thermostat with a multi-meter: Unplug your dryer and open your dryer's cabinet.  Locate your cycling thermostat, it is often found on the blower housing or elsewhere in the airflow ducting.  Test the thermostat for continuity by using a multi-meter on Rx1. To do this, touch the probes to the thermostat's terminals.  If you receive a reading other than infinity or zero, you need a replacement cycling thermostat.  
   - Too hot
   - Causes
       -- Cycling Thermostat: The cycling thermostat in your dryer monitors the temperature in the blower housing and cycles the heating element or gas burner on and off as required to maintain the proper temperature. If the thermostat becomes defective or cannot accurately sense the airflow temperature, the heater or gas burner may stay on too long and create an unsafe temperature in the drum. The cycling thermostat has normally closed contacts that open on temperature rise and therefore testing for continuity will not easily determine if the thermostat is defective. You should first inspect the exhaust vent, blower wheel, drum seals and drive motor to verify that you have proper airflow before replacing the cycling thermostat.   How to test dryer's cycling thermostat using a multi-meter: After ensuring you have unplugged your dryer, open your dryer's cabinet to locate your cycling thermostat. It will be found along the flow of air from the drum, often attached to the blower housing.  In order to test it, gently remove the cycling thermostat from the dryer.  To test for continuity, set your multi-meter to Rx1 and place the prongs on the thermostat's terminals. You should see a reading of zero or infinity.  If your test produces any other reading, you need a replacement cycling thermostat.  
       -- High Limit Thermostat: The high limit or safety thermostat is used to protect the appliance from overheating due to a restricted airflow condition. This thermostat is normally located above the heat source and is designed to activate only when the air flow is reduced enough to allow the heat to rise and trip the thermostat, removing power to the element or gas burner. The thermostat is not designed to trip repeatedly and when this condition happens, the contacts inside may fuse together and no longer provide safety protection. This can allow the burner or element to stay on too long and the temperature may rise to an unsafe level. The high limit thermostat has normally closed contacts that open on temperature rise and therefore testing for continuity will not easily determine if the thermostat is defective. Verify that the exhaust vent is clear and not restricted and that the blower wheel and motor are operating properly before replacing the high limit thermostat. Remove power from the appliance before attempting this repair.   How to test a dryer high limit thermostat with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source and open your dryer's cabinet.   After locating the high limit thermostat, carefully remove it from the dryer in order to test it. It will be located somewhere in the path of air leaving the drum, often on the inside of the exhaust system or on the blower wheel housing.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity.  If your test results in a reading other than zero, you need a replacement high limit thermostat.  
       -- Thermistor: Some newer models of electronic control dryers may use a thermistor in place of a cycling thermostat, to regulate the temperature in the dryer drum. The thermistor senses the airflow temperature as it exits the drum. The thermistor is a solid-state device and will vary in resistance according to the temperature. This resistance is monitored by the electronic control board which operates a relay controlling the heater or burner. If the thermistor becomes insulated with lint or foreign matter or is damaged or otherwise defective, it will not register the proper resistance and the control board may not turn the heater or burner off at the proper temperature. Some models may display a fault code when this happens. If your dryer is displaying a fault code, you can refer to our list of common appliance fault codes to determine the source. You can test the thermistor with a multi-meter if you know what the resistance should be at room temperature. This information may be located on the schematic diagram for the dryer.   How to test a dryer thermistor a multi-meter: Unplug your dryer and open the dryer's cabinet.  Locate and gently remove the thermistor to test it, it is normally located on the blower housing. Allow the thermistor to rest outside of the dryer prior to testing as it needs to be at room temperature to produce a reliable reading.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the prongs on each of the thermistor's terminals.  If the reading does not match what the resistance should be at room temperature, which varies by model, you need a replacement thermistor.  
       -- Exhaust Vent: If your clothes dryer appears to be too hot on top of the cabinet, the problem may be with the exhaust vent. If the vent becomes restricted, air flow will be reduced, and the temperature inside may rise causing the cabinet top to be hotter than normal. This normally results in the high limit safety thermostat tripping and the clothes will take longer to dry. This is a safety concern and the exhaust vent should be checked regularly and cleaned when required.   How to check and clean a dryer's exhaust vent: Disconnect your dryer from the power source as well as the vent hose.  If possible, remove the ducts for easier cleaning.  Use a vent cleaning brush to clean the inside of the ducts and any vent covers. Insert the brush into the ducts and ensure you only spin it counterclockwise, as turning it clockwise could unscrew the segments.  You may need to do this from both the inside and outside, depending on how long your ductwork and brush are.  If you are unable to clean the duct work with a brush, you may need replacement ductwork and/or vents.  
   - Shuts off too soon
   - Causes
       -- Moisture Sensor: Newer models of dryers may use a moisture sensor to control the timer from advancing when the automatic drying cycle is selected. The sensor circuit consists of an electronic control in the console and sensors that are typically located on the front bulkhead of the dryer. When sensor dry is selected the wet clothes in the dryer come in direct contact with the sensors and complete an electrical circuit. This circuit causes the control board's capacitor to discharge and that prevents the timer motor from advancing. When clothes are nearly dry, they fail to complete this circuit and the timer begins to run until the end of the cycle. If these sensors are defective or become coated with fabric softener, then the dryer will shut off before the clothes can dry.   How to clean and test a dryer's moisture sensor: Open your dryer door and locate your moisture sensor. On newer models, it is usually mounted to the lint filter housing.  To clean, lightly rub it with very fine sandpaper to remove any debris or built up additives (e.g. fabric softener).  Wipe the sensor with a damp cloth and place a load of clothes in the dryer and periodically check your clothes to see if they are still damp.  If your dryer still shuts off too soon or continues to run after your clothes are dry, you need a replacement moisture sensor.  
   - Will not tumble
   - Causes
       -- Belt: Dryers use a belt connected to a motor to turn the drum. Over time the belt can wear out or become brittle. If the dryer isn't tumbling, inspect the belt to see if it is worn or broken. The belt should be flexible and have lots of grip on both sides.    How to inspect your dryer's drive belt: Unplug your dryer and make sure that the drum is empty.  In order to locate the drive belt, you will need to remove the front panel of your dryer. It will be looped around the drum, under the idler pulley wheel, and around the drive pulley. Inspect the belt for any signs of burning, fraying, cracking, wear, or other damage. If you find any of the above, you need a replacement belt. 
       -- Idler Pulley Assembly: The idler pulley assembly on a dryer is used to provide tension on the drum belt so that the belt will not slip on the drive motor pulley or drum when the dryer has a load in it. The idler pulley rotates at high speed and over time may fail due to increased friction. One of the symptoms created is a squeaking or squealing noise that can progress to a loud scraping or thumping noise in time.   How to check your dryer's idler pulley: Empty the drum of your dryer and disconnect the dryer from the power source.  Depending on your model, remove the front panel or lower access panel in order to locate the idler pulley. To remove the idler pulley, push the pulley towards the motor to release enough tension on the belt to slide it off.  Manually turn the idler pulley, a properly functioning idler pulley should have little to no resistance once the belt is removed.  Visually inspect the idler pulley for any signs of damage or wear.  If you cannot turn the idler pulley easily or see any signs of damage, you will need replacement idler pulley.  
       -- Maintenance Kit: Some dryer manufacturers produce a dryer maintenance kit that consists of the typical parts that might fail with normal use. The kits will typically include parts that may cause the drum to not tumble such as belts, idler pulley, drum rollers or bearings. Once you determine which part or parts that have failed, you may find it more economical to purchase a maintenance kit.   How to check your dryer's drum support rollers: Unplug your dryer and open your dryer's cabinet. Remove the drum and locate the drum support rollers in order to inspect them for signs of damage or wear. If one or both rollers are worn or damaged, you will need replacement drum support rollers. 
       -- Drive Motor: Gas and electric dryers have a motor that turns the blower and the dryer drum. A defective motor can cause your dryer to not start or tumble and may even produce a humming noise from a bad winding or switch on the motor.   How to test a dryer motor with a multi-meter: After unplugging your dryer, remove the front panel of your dryer to locate the motor. In some models, you will also need to remove the drum belt and/or blower wheel to access the motor.  Carefully remove the motor from the dryer in order to test it.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals of the motor with the probes to test for continuity. You should see a reading of zero or nearly zero.  Place one of the probes on the bare metal housing of the motor and the other on a terminal. You are testing the ground connection and should not receive any reading from this test.  If your motor fails either of the tests above, you need a replacement motor.  
       -- Door Switch: On all dryers, the door switch allows the dryer to start tumbling only when the door is closed. If the dryer does not tumble when the door is closed, then the door switch may be defective.   How to test your dryer's door switch with a multi-meter: Ensure that the dryer is unplugged before starting.  Locate and remove your dryer's door switch, it will be near the door opening. Depending on your model you may need to remove the front panel in order to access the door switch.  Using a multi-meter set to Rx1, touch each of the terminals with the probes. You should receive a reading of infinity.  With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on and hold the switch. The reading should now be zero.  If your switch fails either of these tests, you need a replacement door switch.  
   - Takes too long to dry
   - Causes
       -- Lint Filter: A lint filter that is full of lint will restrict airflow and lengthen dry times. To keep your dryer working correctly, clean out the lint folder after each use.   How to check the lint filter in a dryer: Remove the lint filter from the dryer and use a narrow soft-bristled brush to clean inside the slot for the lint filter. Wash the filter in warm soapy water to clean buildups of fabric softeners or other additives.  Inspect the filter for damage or wear. If it is damaged, you will need a replacement lint filter.  
       -- Blower Wheel: A blower wheel that is not firmly attached to the drive motor can slip and therefore not move air fast enough to properly dry clothes or even reduce airflow to the point where the high limit thermostat may trip and turn off the heat circuit.   How to tell if your dryer's blower wheel is bad:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source and remove the back panel.  After locating the blower wheel, ensure it is firmly attached to the shaft. Inspect the blower wheel, and it's housing, for any signs of wear or damage. You should also remove any foreign objects you may find near the blower wheel.  Remove the front panel and drum from your dryer to inspect the hub of the wheel for any signs of wear or damage.  If you find any signs of wear or damage, you will need a replacement blower wheel.  
       -- Coil: In gas dryers, defective gas valve coils can create a symptom of taking too long to dry if they are intermittent. Check for proper flame ignition for the complete dry cycle to determine if this may be the cause.   How to test gas dryer valve coils with a multi-meter: Before beginning, ensure that you have disconnected your dryer from both the power source and the gas.  Remove the lower access panel in order to locate the gas control valve.  Once you locate the gas control valve, remove the coils from the rest of the valve.  With your multi-meter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the coil's terminals to test for continuity. You are looking for a reading between 1000 & 2000 ohms.  If you receive a reading outside this range, you need replacement coils.  
       -- Felt Drum Seal: The drum seals are used to prevent excess air from entering the dryer drum and act as a cushion between the drum and the front and rear bulkheads. The drum seals are made up of a felt like material. If the seal is torn or is worn, then clothing can become stuck in the gap when the drum is turning. This can produce a scraping or thumping noise and the clothes can also be ripped and/or have black marks on them.   How to check your dryer's felt drum seal:  After unplugging your dryer, open your dryer cabinet and remove the drum.  With the drum removed, inside the seals for any signs of burning, wear, or damage.   If they show signs of wear or damage, you will need a replacement drum seal. On models with more than one felt seal, it is recommended to replace them all at the same time as they wear at approximately the same rate.  
       -- Door Seal: When the door is closed in gas and electric dryers the door seal helps to keep cooler air from entering the drum. Keeping the correct temperature at all times inside the dryer ensures that the clothes will dry efficiently.   How to inspect dryer door seals: Locate your door seal and carefully remove it from your dryer door. Models differ in how the door seal is attached, consult your owner's manual before beginning to ensure you do not damage your door seal attempting to remove it. Some models also require the door to be removed prior to removing the door seal. Visually inspect your dryer seal for any signs of tearing, wear, damage, or mold.  If there is, you will need a replacement door seal.  
   - No heat or not enough heat
   - Causes
       -- Heating Element: In electric dryers, heat is generated by the heating element. The element is a coil of heating wire enclosed in a metal chamber. Electric current flowing through the coil creates heat and the air being pulled through the chamber absorbs this heat. If the element is defective, then it will not heat.     How to test a dryer's heating element with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source and locate the heating element.  Depending on your model, you may need to open your dryer's cabinet to access the heating element. Remove the heating element from the dryer and visually inspect it for signs of damage or burning.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to element terminals to test for continuity.   If you receive a reading of infinity, you need a replacement heating element.  
       -- High Limit Thermostat: The high limit thermostat is a safety device mounted on the heating chamber and is designed to prevent the dryer from overheating when the exhaust vent is restricted. A restricted vent will cause the high limit thermostat to trip or activate, interrupting the circuit to the heating element or gas valve. The high limit thermostat is not designed to activate repeatedly like a cycling thermostat and will eventually fail causing a no heat symptom.     How to test a dryer's high limit thermostat with a multi-meter: Unplug your dryer and open your dryer's cabinet to locate the high limit thermostat. It will be found somewhere in the path of air leaving the drum, often on the blower wheel housing or inside the exhaust system.  Carefully remove the thermostat from the dryer to test it.    With your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test for continuity by touching the probes to each terminal. You should receive a reading of zero or infinity.   If your test does not produce either of those readings, you need a replacement high limit thermostat.  
       -- Cycling Thermostat: Cycling thermostats control the temperature inside the dryer drum. They are designed to "cycle" the heating element on and off to maintain the correct amount of heat. Cycling thermostats are normally located on the blower housing or elsewhere in the internal airflow ducting. Over time, the cycling thermostat can become defective.     How to test a dryer's cycling thermostat with a multi-meter: After disconnecting your dryer from the power source, locate your cycling thermostat. It is often found on the blower housing or elsewhere in the internal airflow ducting. You will need to open your dryer's cabinet to locate it.  Using pliers to gently pull on the metal connectors and not the wires, remove the cycling thermostat.    Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting.  Touch the probes to the thermostat's terminals. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of infinity or zero.  If your reading is anything other than infinity or zero, you need a replacement cycling thermostat.  
       -- Igniter: Newer gas dryers have an igniter or glow bar, which ignites the gas released by the gas valve. When the dryer is calling for heat, the igniter will begin to glow as it heats up. When maximum temperature is reached, the gas valve will open and the gas will be ignited.    How to test a dryer's ignitor with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source as well as the gas source prior to starting.  After opening your dryer's cabinet, locate your igniter. It is usually located next to the gas valve burner tube and will be coil-shaped or flat, depending on your model.   Very carefully remove the igniter to test it. Igniters are very fragile and should be handled accordingly.   With your multi-meter on the lowest setting for resistance, test your igniter for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals.  If you receive a reading of 50-400 ohms, your igniter has continuity. If your test produces any other reading, you need a replacement igniter.  
       -- Radiant Flame Sensor: The radiant sensor or flame sensor is designed to sense heat from either the igniter or the burner flame in gas dryers. The sensor detects heat from the igniter to open the gas valve, also detects heat from the burner flame to keep the valve open. If the sensor is defective, either the igniter won't glow, or the gas valve won't open. If the igniter does not glow, then you should check the radiant sensor for continuity with a multi-meter. If the igniter glows continuously and the gas valve does not open to light a flame, then the electrical contacts inside the sensor may be stuck closed and the sensor will need to be replaced.   How to test your dryer's radiant flame sensor with a multi-meter: After unplugging your dryer and disconnecting the gas hose, open your dryer's cabinet to locate the radiant flame sensor. It will be found next to the igniter.   Carefully remove the radiant flame sensor from the dryer in order to test it.  Touching each of the probes to the terminals, with your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, you are looking for a reading of zero.  If you do not receive a reading of zero, you need a replacement radiant flame sensor.  
       -- Gas Control Valve: In gas dryers, an integral part of the gas burner system is the gas valve. The flame sensor and igniter circuit provide power to the gas valve. When this circuit is complete, the coils will be energized, and the valve will open releasing gas into the burner where it ignites. A symptom of a defective valve is an igniter that glows but then shuts off without a flame being produced. The valve may also function correctly at the beginning of the drying cycle but can fail later into the drying cycle resulting in not enough heat being produced to dry clothing properly.   How to test your dryer's gas control valve with a multi-meter: Disconnect the gas hose and power source from the dryer.   Remove the lower access panel from the dryer to access the gas control valve.   After removing the gas control valve, remove the coils from the valve.  With your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to the coil's terminals. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of 1000-2000 ohms.   If you receive the reading above, your coils are not defective, and you may need a replacement gas control valve.  
       -- Coils: Modern gas dryers have electric coils that operate the gas valve. They are located on top of the gas valve and are controlled by the heat circuit. If one or more of the coils are not working, then the gas valve won't open, and you will have a no heat symptom. The coils may function normally at the beginning of a cycle but may fail later on as they heat up internally.    How to test dryer coils with a multi-meter: After disconnecting the gas hose and unplugging the dryer, remove the lower access panel to locate the gas control valve.  Remove the coils from the gas control valve.   Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and test for continuity by touching the coil's terminals with the probes.  If you receive any reading other than 1000-2000 ohms of resistance, you need replacement coils.  
       -- Temperature Sensor: Temperature sensors are devices that change resistance depending on the temperature. The internal temperature of gas and electric dryers is managed by cycling thermostats on most dryers and by temperature sensors on some electronic controlled dryers. Depending on the dryer it may use multiple sensors to regulate the temperature.    How to check your dryer's temperature sensor with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source.  Open your dryer's cabinet in order to locate the temperature sensor(s). It will be found somewhere along the path of airflow from the drum.   Carefully remove the temperature sensor and allow it to rest to ensure it is at room temperature, as you need to test the resistance at room temperature.  Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to the terminals. If you receive a reading of anything other than zero, you need a replacement temperature sensor(s).  
       -- Timer: Located in the control console of the dryer the timer consists of a small motor connected to a series of gears that rotate cams, which turn electric contacts off and on inside the timer. The timer contacts control the dryer motor as well as the heat circuit. A defect in the timer's electrical contacts can cause the dryer to stop producing heat and the timer will need to be replaced.    How to test a dryer's timers with a multi-meter: After unplugging your dryer, remove the control console in order to locate the timer. Depending on your model, you may be able to remove it at this stage, but on some models, you will also need to remove the rear panel.  After removing the timer from your dryer, use a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting to test for continuity by placing the probes on the timer's terminals.   If you receive a reading of anything other than 2000-3000 ohms of resistance, you need a replacement timer.  
       -- Thermal Fuse: The thermal fuse is designed to prevent the dryer from overheating. Once a dryer's thermal fuse has blown, it is no longer of any use. If your dryer's fuse is blown, you will have to replace it.    How to test if a dryer's thermal fuse has blown: Unplug your dryer and remove the back panel to access the thermal fuse(s).  Remove the thermal fuse(s) from the dryer to test it. It is usually found on the heating element and/or blower housing.  Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity.  If you receive a reading other than zero or infinity, there is no continuity and you need a replacement thermal fuse(s).  
   - Noisy
   - Causes
       -- Drum Glides or Slides: In gas and electric dryers, the drum glides provide support to the front part of the dryer's drum on both sides. The glides are made from either teflon, nylon or plastic and have a felt or cork backing depending on the maker of the dryer. The glides provide a smooth surface for the drum to rotate on, but they can wear out over time producing a scraping sound because of the metal-to-metal contact.     How to inspect your dryer's drum glides:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source.   Remove your dryer's cabinet to locate your drum glides. On most models, the Drum glides are installed on the front bulkhead, either at the top or the bottom.   Visually inspect your glides for signs of wear or damage.   If any of your drum glides appear worn, you will need a set of replacement drum glides.   
       -- Drum Bearings: In some models of gas and electric dryers, the drum is supported at the rear by a bearing. Depending on the model of dryer, the bearing may be a ball and socket, or a shaft connected to a sleeve bushing. A defective rear bearing will produce a squealing or squeaking noise and will need to be replaced.   How to inspect your dryer's drum bearings: Unplug your dryer and ensure that there is no residual water or clothing in the drum.   Manually spin your dryer drum, listening for any strange noises.   Grasping the front edge of your drum, attempt to move your drum upwards, towards yourself, and to the back of the dryer.   If you can easily move your drum in any direction, you may need a replacement drum bearing.   
       -- Drum Support Rollers & Shaft: Several models of gas and electric dryers have rollers that support the drum. The rollers are typically located on the rear bulkhead and some models will have them on the front bulkhead as well. These rollers can wear out from usage causing the dryer's drum to not rotate freely and create a squealing noise or in some cases, a thumping noise. Drum rollers should be replaced as a set as they normally will wear evenly.    How to check your dryer's drum support rollers:  After disconnecting your dryer from the power source, open the dryer's cabinet and remove the drum.   Visually inspect your drum support rollers for signs of damage or wear.    If one or both rollers are worn or damaged, you will need replacement drum support rollers.  
       -- Drive Belt: Gas and electric dryers use a belt to rotate the dryer's drum. The belt can become hard and brittle with age, and portions of the belt may separate and cause a thumping noise when the drum is turning.   How to inspect your dryer's drive belt: Disconnect your dryer from the power source and ensure that the drum is empty.    Remove the front panel of your dryer and locate the drive belt, it will be looped around the drum, under the idler pulley wheel, and around the drive pulley.    Visually inspect the drive belt for signs of wear, cracking, fraying, or burning.    If the belt is damaged, you will need a replacement drive belt.     	
       -- Idler Pulley: The idler pulley on a dryer is used to provide tension on the drum belt so that the belt will not slip on the drive motor pulley or drum when the dryer has a load in it. The idler pulley rotates at high speed and over time may fail due to increased friction. A squeaking or squealing noise can be heard and can progress to a loud scraping or thumping noise in time.    How to check your dryer's idler pulley:  After disconnecting your dryer from the power source and emptying the drum, remove the front panel or lower access panel, depending on your model.    To inspect the idler pulley, you need to first remove the drive belt by gently pushing the idler pulley towards the motor to release the tension on the belt, and then slide the belt off.    With the belt removed, you should be able to turn the idler pulley freely with little to no resistance. If you can't, you will need a replacement.    Closely inspect the idler pulley, as well as the shaft, for signs of wear or damage.      If you are unable to turn the idler pulley easily, or it is visibly damaged, you will need a replacement idler pulley.   
       -- Felt Drum Seal: The drum seals are used to prevent excess air from entering the dryer drum and act as a cushion between the drum and the front and rear bulkheads. The drum seals are made up of a felt like material. If the seal is torn or worn, then clothing can become stuck in the gap when the drum is turning. This can produce a scraping or thumping noise and the clothes can also be ripped and/or have black marks on them.   How to check your dryer's felt drum seal:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source.      Open your dryer cabinet and remove the drum.      With the drum removed, inspect your seal(s) for signs of wear or damage.      If they are worn or damaged, you will need a replacement felt drum seal. If your model has more than one seal it is recommended to replace them all at the same time, as these seals wear at approximately the same rate.      	
       -- Blower Wheel & Housing: The blower wheel in gas and electric dryers is used to draw the air from the heating chamber, through the drum and out the exhaust vent. The blower wheel is normally made of plastic and can wear out over time. It is typically attached to the end of the motor and may be threaded onto the shaft or held in place with a clamp. If the blower wheel becomes loose then the symptom is usually a loud thumping or roaring noise is usually heard.   How to tell if your dryer's blower wheel is bad:  After unplugging your dryer, remove the back panel and locate the blower wheel, in most models it is in the bottom left corner.   Visually inspect the blower wheel and its housing for damage, you should also check for any foreign objects around the blower wheel that may be causing the noise.  To inspect the hub of the wheel, remove the front panel and drum from your dryer.  Inspect the hub for any signs of wear or damage. If there are any signs of wear or damage on the hub or the wheel itself, you will need a replacement blower wheel. 
       -- Baffle or Lifter: Baffles or lifters located on the inner surface of the drum are used to tumble the clothes in your dryer. If a baffle becomes loose it can produce a thumping or banging noise and will eventually break off.   How to check your dryer's baffle:  Open the door of your dryer and inspect the baffles for any signs of cracking, wear, or other damage.   Check to see if any loose change or metal objects have become lodged underneath the baffles, as this may cause a rattling noise or damage your clothing.   If there is damage, or the baffles are loose, you will need replacement baffles.   
       -- Motor: Gas and electric dryers have a motor that turns the blower and the dryer drum. A defective motor can produce a variety of sounds, such as a ratting noise from a loose pulley, a high-pitched noise from a bad bearing or bushing or a humming noise from a bad winding or switch on the motor.    How to test a dryer motor with a multi-meter:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source and open your dryer's cabinet to locate the motor. Depending on your model, you may need to remove the drum belt or blower wheel to access the motor.   After locating the motor, disconnect the wire leads from the wiring harness and remove the motor from the dryer.   With your multimeter on the Rx1 setting, touch the meter's probes to one terminal each. Your motor should show a reading of zero, or close to zero.   To check the ground connection, place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor, and place the other probe on each terminal, one at a time. You should not receive any reading from this test.   If your motor fails either of the tests above, you need a replacement motor.  
   - Will not start
   - Causes
       -- Door Switch: On all dryers, the door switch allows the dryer to start tumbling only when the door is closed. If the dryer does not start when the door is closed then the door switch may be defective.     How to test your dryer's door switch with a multi-meter:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source and locate your dryer's door switch. It will be near the door opening in the front model.    To remove the switch, in some dryers you are able to simply pop it out of place or remove it with a single screw. In others, you will need to remove the front panel to access the door switch.    Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch each tester probe to each of the switch's terminals. You should receive a reading of infinity.   While the probes are still touching the terminals, press in on and hold the switch. The reading should change to zero.  If your switch fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement door switch.  
       -- Thermal Fuse: The thermal fuse is a safety device found in some dryers to prevent overheating. It is a heat sensitive fuse and will open if the temperature becomes too hot and will typically interrupt power to the drive motor and cause the dryer to be inoperable. The thermal fuse is about an inch or more long and normally embedded in a white plastic housing. Some brands of dryers use more than one thermal fuse.    How to test a dryer's thermal fuse with a multi-meter:  After disconnecting your dryer from the power source, remove the back panel of your dryer to locate the thermal fuse. It is usually located on the blower housing and/or the heating element.  With your multi-meter set to Rx1, touch the probes to each terminal, you are testing for continuity and should have a reading of zero or infinity.  If your fuse does not pass this test, you need a replacement thermal fuse.  
       -- Rotary or Push Start Switch: Located in the dryer's main console is the start switch. When depressed it sends power to the drive motor and starts the dryer tumbling. If the dryer doesn't start, then the start switch may be defective. The switch can be tested for continuity using a multi-meter. Unplug the dryer before you test the start switch.   How to test your dryer's rotary switch:  Unplug your dryer and remove the control console panel on the top of your dryer to locate the rotary switch.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes on the switch's terminals. You should receive a reading of infinity.  With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on and hold the switch. The reading should change to zero.  If your switch fails either of the tests above, you need a replacement rotary switch.  
       -- Drive Motor: Gas and electric dryers have a motor that turns the blower and the dryer drum. A defective motor can cause your dryer to not start and may even produce a humming noise from a bad winding or switch on the motor.    How to test your dryer's drive motor:  After unplugging your dryer, locate the motor by opening your dryer's cabinet. Disconnect your dryer from the power source and open your dryer's cabinet to locate the motor. You may need to remove the drum belt or blower wheel to access the motor depending on your model.  Using pliers to pull on the metal leads and not the wires themselves, remove the motor from the dryer.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and your motor should show a reading of 0, or close to 0.  Place one probe on the bare metal housing of the motor, and place the other probe on each terminal one at a time to check the ground connection. You should not receive any reading from this test.  If your motor fails either of the tests above, you need a replacement motor.  
       -- Main Control Board: Electronic controlled dryers will use a circuit board to operate the dryer's electrical components much like the timer in timer-controlled models. The circuit board is normally located in the dryer's main control panel. If the dryer is not starting, then inspect this part as a potential cause.    How to test a dryer's main control board:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source.  Remove your dryer's top panel and/or control panel, depending on your model, to locate the main control board.  Remove the main control board, we recommend taking a photo of the wiring connections to ensure you can properly reconnect them.

       -- Door Switch: The door switch is a safety feature found in all dryers. It is an on and off type switch that prevents the dryer drum from turning when the door is opened. If the dryer continues to tumble after the door is open the problem is most likely the door switch.   How to test your dryer's door switch with a multi-meter:  After unplugging your dryer, locate your door switch. It will be near the door opening.   Remove the switch to test it. In some models, you can simply pop it out or remove it with a screw at this stage. In other models, you will need to remove the front panel first.   Set your multi-meter to Rx1 and touch the terminals of the switch with the probes. You should receive a reading of infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on and hold the switch. The reading should change to zero.  If your switch fails either of these tests, you need a replacement door switch.  
       -- Timer: Located in the control console of the dryer the timer consists of a small motor connected to a series of gears that rotate cams, which turn electric contacts off and on inside the timer. The timer contacts control the dryer motor as well as the heat circuit and the timer motor itself. A defective timer motor or a defect in the timer's electrical contacts can cause the timer motor to fail and the timer will need to be replaced.   How to test a dryer's timer with a multi-meter:  Disconnect your dryer from the power source and remove the control console.  Locate and remove your timer. On some models, you will be able to remove it at this stage. In others, you will need to remove the panel behind the control console first in order to remove the switch.  After removing the timer, with your multi-meter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the timer's terminals. You are testing for continuity and should see a reading between 2000 & 3000 ohms.  If your test produces a reading outside this range, you need a replacement timer.  
       -- Cycling Thermostat: On gas and electric dryers that have an "Auto Dry" cycle, the cycling thermostat is often used to advance the timer as well regulate the drum temperature. Essentially, the thermostat will alternately turn on the heat source or the timer motor when the temperature has been satisfied.   How to test the cycling thermostat in a dryer: Unplug your dryer and locate the cycling thermostat. You will need to open the dryer's cabinet to locate it. It will be found somewhere along the path of air coming from the drum, often on the blower housing.  Gently remove your cycling thermostat in order to test it.  Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes onto the thermostat's terminals. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of infinity or zero.  If your test produces a reading that is not zero or infinity, you need a replacement cycling thermostat.  
       -- Cool Down Thermostat: Some dryers will use a cool down thermostat to tumble the clothes without heat, at the end of the dry cycle. Power is routed through this thermostat to the drive motor to keep it running until the drum temperature has dropped to a specific temperature. If this thermostat fails it can cause the drum to turn indefinitely or until the door is opened.   How to test a dryer's cool down thermostat with a multi-meter: Disconnect your dryer from the power source and open the dryer's cabinet to locate the cool down thermostat. It is usually found near the blower wheel housing.   Using pliers to gently grasp the metal connectors and not the wires themselves, remove the cool down thermostat from the dryer.   Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test for continuity by placing the prongs on the thermostat's terminals. You should see a reading of zero or infinity.  If your thermostat produces any other reading, you need a replacement cool down thermostat.

Refer to your owner's manual to determine what the reading of a functional temperature sensor should be for your model. Once you know this, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the terminals to test for continuity. If you receive a reading outside the recommended range, you need a replacement temperature sensor.
       -- Infinite Switch: The infinite switch on the control panel controls the power to each surface element. If you have no heat at an element and the element and terminal block check ok, then you may have a defective infinite switch. How to test an oven infinite switch with a multimeter: Before beginning this test, or any other test on an oven, verify that you have disconnected the power from your appliance. Infinite switches are most often found by removing the back panel. Locate and remove the infinite switch from your appliance in order to test it for continuity. You should also inspect the wires near the switch for any signs of overheated wires or faulty terminals. After removing the switch, set your multimeter to Rx1. You are going to be testing for continuity between the following sets of terminals: L1 & H1, L2 & H2. If either of the tests above don't show continuity, you need a replacement infinite switch.
       -- Electronic Control Board: Most modern ovens use an electronic control board to control the oven functions. These models will use the control board to operate the oven safety valve on a gas range or oven, and the bake and broil elements on an electric range or oven. How to inspect the electronic control board in an oven or range: Begin by verifying that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source. Locate and remove the electronic control board in order to inspect it. It will most likely be located directly behind the control panel. You will likely need to remove the top panel to access it. Inspect your control board for any signs of burnt, shorted, or damaged contacts. You should also look for any other signs of wear or damage on the control board. If you find any of the symptoms described above, you may need a replacement electronic control board.
       -- Safety Valve: The oven safety valve (also called the gas valve) is the part that ensures that gas is not released until the igniter has reached the correct temperature needed to ignite the gas. While this part can fail, it is uncommon. How to test the safety valve in your oven with a multimeter: Allow your oven to completely cool before beginning and then unplug your oven/range. Locate your safety valve, it will likely be found near the burners and/or igniters. You will need to remove the back panel as well as heat shields in order to access the valve. Once you have found it, remove it from the appliance. Set your multimeter to Rx1 to test it for continuity. On some models there will be two sets of terminals: one for broil and one for bake, if your model has two sets of terminals, simply test each set individually. Using the meter's probes, touch the terminals of the valve. Your reading should be in the 0-50 ohm range.  If your reading is not in this range, or the test does not produce a reading, you will need a replacement safety valve.
       -- Oven Burner Igniter: The oven burner igniter commonly known as the hot surface igniter is used in modern gas oven burners to open the gas valve and to ignite the gas. As the igniter draws electric current it will heat to a high temperature and glow, as well as cause the bi metal in the oven safety valve to warp and open the valve releasing the gas to be ignited. This sequence normally takes about a minute. Igniters come in both flat and round styles and are very fragile. How to inspect an oven burner igniter: After ensuring that you have disconnected the gas supply from your appliance, begin by determining if the issue is with your gas supply lines or your igniter. If you stove-top igniters are functioning normally, but your oven won't light, then it is likely an issue with the igniter and not the gas. Locate the igniter in your oven. The location varies between models, but it is generally found near the oven burners. Depending on your model, you may need to remove the bottom cover of your oven to access it. Once you have located it, gently clean any dirt or debris off it using a toothbrush, softly blow on it when you are done. Afterward, clean the pilot hole where the gas comes out using a small needle to remove any dirt or gunk that may be blocking the gas flow. Inspect your igniter to see if your issue has been resolved, double check that you have disconnected the gas supply and hit the ignition button on your stove. Visually inspect to see if your igniter is sparking. If your igniter is not sparking, you will need a replacement oven burner igniter.
Appliance: Refrigerator
Symptoms:
   - Ice maker not making ice
   - Causes
       -- Water Fill Tubes: Inspect the ice maker mold to see if there are ice cubes present. If there are no cubes or very small cubes, then you should look for issues with the water fill system.  How to inspect your refrigerator's water fill tubes: Before beginning, disconnect both the power and water source from your refrigerator. At the back of the icemaker, inspect the fill tube and the fill cup area at the back of the ice maker to make sure that they are not frozen. If there is an ice buildup in that area, confirm no foreign objects have disrupted the flow of water into the fill cup.  Inspect the outlet tubing from the fill valve to the ice maker fill tube for any signs of restrictions. If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need replacement water fill tubes.
       -- Water Inlet Valve: Some water inlet valves may have a screen to filter debris before it can enter the valve. If the screen is plugged, water flow will be restricted, and the result will be small or layered ice cubes. Remove and clean the screen if it is clogged. If dirt has gotten into the valve it may not shut off completely and will continuously drip water into the ice maker fill tube and will eventually freeze up. Low household water pressure or a restriction at the manual shut off valve will also cause the water inlet valve to not shut off completely and create this same condition. Self piercing saddle valves are the most common shut off valve to cause this problem as the hole that is pierced in the water line is often too small and will more easily become restricted.   How to check the water inlet valve in a refrigerator with a multi-meter: Disconnect your appliance from the power and water source before beginning. Remove the rear access panel and locate your water inlet valve, it is usually found near the bottom. Before removing the inlet valve, look for any signs of leaks or loose connectors in the valve inlet supply. If no issues are found, inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage.  Inspect the outlet tubing for any brittle tubing, abrasions, cracks, or any other damage. If you do not locate any leaks, disconnect the water inlet valve and remove it from the refrigerator to test it Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.
       -- Ice & Water Filter: If equipped, the Ice and Water filter in your refrigerator is responsible for removing any debris or contaminants from your water that may remain after local water treatment. Most filters contain and are made up of carbon and fabric filter. Over time, the filter may become restricted and reduce the water flow to the ice maker, causing a symptom of little or no ice. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.  How to inspect your refrigerator's ice and water filter:  Determine when you last replaced your water filter. Replacement frequency varies by model and local water quality, but you should never go longer than 12 months without replacing your water filter. Locate your water filter. Location varies by model and brand, but it is often found inside the unit attached to the ceiling or back corner, behind the base grill, or in the water line leading to the fridge. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to turn off the water supply before removing the filter. Due to the variety of filters and placements we suggest you follow brand specific install instructions or refer to manufacturer guidelines. Before installing the new filter note the install date on the filter or on your calendar. If it has been longer than the manufacturer recommended guidelines, or you filter is damaged, you will need a replacement ice and water filter.  
       -- Ice Maker Assembly & Replacement Ice Maker: If there are no ice buildup issues or suspected problems with the water supply, then you may have a problem with the ice maker control. The most common type of ice maker used in modern refrigerators is the heat release ice maker. The testing procedure for the heat release ice maker involves a live voltage test, consequently it should only be performed by a qualified professional. However, the issue may also be related to the water fill system or the ice maker assembly. How to inspect your refrigerator's ice maker assembly: Begin by disconnecting the water source and unplugging your refrigerator. Open the freezer door in order to inspect the fill cup area and the fill tube itself for any signs of damage, wear, or freezing.  Inspect the outlet tubing from the fill valve to the ice maker fill tube for any signs of restrictions.  If there is an ice buildup in either area, confirm no foreign objects have disrupted the flow of water into the fill cup, and allow the freezer to defrost to see if that resolves the issue. If any issues are found while performing the checks above & defrosting the freezer did not solve the issue, you will need a replacement ice maker assembly. If nothing obvious has caused the ice buildup, then suspect the inlet valve or tubing.
   - Noisy
   - Causes
       -- Condenser Fan Motor: Most modern frost-free refrigerators will have a fan cooled condenser coil. The condenser fan circulates air through the condenser coil to remove heat as well as circulating air over the drain pan to evaporate the defrost water. If your fridge is making a loud noise, the condenser fan motor could be to blame. The condenser fan motor runs at the same time as the evaporator motor and the compressor. In addition to noise, your fridge might not be staying as cool as normal and/or may be turning on and off regularly.  How to inspect a refrigerator condenser fan motor: Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and then remove the rear access panel.  Locate the condenser fan motor, it is usually found near the compressor at the bottom rear of the refrigerator. Visually inspect the condenser fan motor for any signs of wear or damage. Look for any debris or obstructions that could be preventing the fan from moving freely. If the fan motor is seized or worn, you will need a replacement condenser fan motor.
       -- Evaporator Fan Motor: The evaporator fan motor is responsible for pulling air over the evaporator coils when the compressor is running. If your refrigerator is making a loud noise that appears to be coming from the freezer area, a faulty evaporator fan motor could be to blame. You may also notice that your refrigerator is not staying as cold as normal, or your ice is taking longer to freeze.  How to inspect a refrigerator evaporator fan motor:  After unplugging your refrigerator, remove the evaporator fan cover. The evaporator fan cover is located inside the unit in the freezer compartment. Inspect the evaporator motor for any signs of wear or damage. If there is a significant amount of ice on the motor, defrost your freezer and see if that resolves the issue. Attempt to manually turn the motor shaft, it should turn freely with minimal resistance. If you cannot turn it easily, or if it is noticeably worn, you need a replacement evaporator fan motor.
       -- Evaporator Fan Motor Grommet: The evaporator fan motor grommet is used to isolate the motor from the mounting bracket and reduce vibration noise. Regular wear and tear can cause the grommets to wear or become detached, which can increase vibration and cause excess noise.   How to check a refrigerator's evaporator fan motor grommets: Unplug your refrigerator. Remove the evaporator fan cover, which will be found inside the freezer compartment. Inspect the grommet to see if it has fallen off, or it if is showing signs of wear or damage.. If any of the above are true, you will need a replacement evaporator fan motor grommet.
   - Will not start
   - Causes
       -- Overload Or Relay-Start Capacitor: The overload relay is a protection device used in the compressor circuit on your refrigerator. Power is applied to the compressor motor windings through the overload device, and the relay is used to add the start winding in the circuit until the compressor is at running speed. If the fans are running and your compressor won't start or if you hear a clicking sound from the unit, check the overload relay for signs of overheating or arcing.  How to test a refrigerator's overload or relay-start capacitor with a multi-meter: Begin by ensuring you have unplugged your refrigerator, and then remove the rear panel. Locate and remove your overload or relay-start capacitor. On modern refrigerators the overload relay is usually a combined part and plugs directly onto the side of the compressor. There may also be a start capacitor attached to the relay overload assembly, which provides increased starting voltage to the compressor windings. To test, begin by discharging the capacitor, then set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes onto the terminals of the overload capacitor and/or the relay-start capacitor. The reading you should receive will vary from model to model, and may be indicated on the outside of the capacitor, or in your owner's manual.    If your test does not produce the reading the manufacturer recommends, you need a replacement overload or relay-start capacitor. If your tests do produce the recommended readings you may have a defective compressor, which will need to be tested by a qualified professional as it is a live circuit test.
       -- Cold Control & Temperature Control: The cold control is a temperature-controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If your refrigerator won't start and no fans are running, then you may have a defective control.   How to test your fridge's cold control & temperature control with a multi-meter: After disconnecting your appliance from the power source, open your refrigerator door and locate the control. It will be located behind the temperature adjustment knob and is usually found in the fresh food section control panel. Remove the control from the fridge in order to test it. Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, set your control to the lowest (warmest) setting, and place the probes on the terminals. You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading of infinity. With the probes still on the terminals, adjust the control to higher (colder) and higher settings, your reading should then change to zero, indicating that you have continuity. If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control.
       -- Electronic Control Board: Some newer refrigerators are controlled by an Electronic Control Board that monitors temperatures and controls the compressor, fans and defrost system. If your refrigerator will not start, the control board could be at fault. Electronic controls are complex and expensive. You should first verify that there is no power being supplied to the compressor, that you have incoming power to the control board and that the external controls are functioning properly before condemning the electronic control.  How to inspect your refrigerator's electronic control board: Ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Open your refrigerator door to locate and remove the electronic control board from your appliance. It will be located inside the control box, which is usually found attached to the top or side of the fridge. Look on the control board for signs of arcing, burnt connections, damaged foil, wear, or any other damage. If you find any of the above, you need a replacement electronic control board.
   - Light not working
   - Causes
       -- Light Bulb Or Lamp: Most light bulbs or lamps can be checked visually for a broken filament or can be checked with a multi-meter for continuity. You can also simply replace the bulb with a new one.  How to test a refrigerator lightbulb with a multi-meter. Remove the bulb from the refrigerator. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting. Place one probe on the bottom of the lightbulb, and place the other on the threading of the bulb. If you receive a reading of infinity, you need a replacement lightbulb.
       -- Light Sockets: If you have verified that the light bulb or lamp is not defective, then you should next inspect the socket.  How to inspect the light sockets of a refrigerator: Unplug your refrigerator before close inspection of the socket as this is a live voltage circuit. Inspect the socket for discolored terminals or heat damaged sockets that may prevent good connectivity to the light bulb or lamp. If you find either of the above, you need a replacement light socket.
       -- Door Light Switch: The interior light of your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If this switch malfunctions the light might not turn on consistently, if at all.   How to test a refrigerator door light switch with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator and locate your door light switch. The location of the switch varies depending on the model of your refrigerator, but it is usually located somewhere near the top of the door opening. The switch is often mounted into the interior plastic liner and care should be taken when removing it to prevent damage to the liner. Remove the switch in order to test it. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting to test the switch for continuity and place the probes on the switch's terminals. The multi-meter reading should change from infinity to a reading of zero. Keep the leads touching the terminals and press in on the switch. The reading should change back to infinity.  If the results you receive are not consistent with these results, you need a replacement door switch.
       -- Light Bulb & Ice Dispenser: If your model has an ice and water dispenser with a light bulb you should first verify that the bulb is good. These lights are normally low wattage and are not designed to be used as night lights. Extended periods of usage will typically cause premature failure of the bulb or damage to the socket. Most models will have an on/off switch on the control panel and that may be defective. You can check the switch for continuity with a multi-meter. The lamp or bulb socket may also be defective and the control plate will need to be removed for inspection.  How to test a refrigerator ice dispenser light on/off switch: Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source before beginning. Locate and remove your control panel cover to access the on/off switch. Remove the on/off switch from the appliance in order to test it. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes on the switch's terminals. You should receive a reading of zero. With the probes still on the terminals press in on the switch, the reading should change to infinity. If your tests produce results different from those above, you will need a replacement dispenser door switch.
   - Fridge and Freezer are too warm
   - Causes
       -- Cold Control Or Temperature Control: The cold control is a temperature-controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If the compressor and fans are operating normally but not running often enough or long enough to maintain the correct temperatures in the fresh food and freezer sections, then the cold control may be defective or out of calibration. Normal fresh food temperatures are in the 38° Fahrenheit range with the control set to mid-point. Verify that the capillary tube or sensing bulb is not damaged or out of position and that the wire terminals are not loose or corroded.   How to test your fridge's cold control & temperature control with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator before beginning, then open your refrigerator door and locate the control. It will be located behind the temperature adjustment knob and is usually found in the fresh food section control panel. After removing the control from the appliance, turn the control to the warmest setting, set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals  You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading of infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, adjust the control to higher (colder) and higher settings. Your reading should change to zero, indicating that you have continuity. If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control.
       -- Evaporator Fan Motor: The evaporator fan motor is used to circulate the cold air throughout the refrigerator when the compressor is running. If the fan is defective, then temperatures in the freezer section will rise slowly and temperatures in the fresh food section will rise more rapidly and the compressor will run longer and more frequently than normal. With the compressor running you should also hear the evaporator fan running at the same time, as well as the condenser fan which is located next to the compressor.  How to inspect a refrigerator evaporator fan motor:  Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and remove the evaporator fan cover, which will be found in the freezer compartment. The motor shaft should turn freely with minimal resistance, attempt to turn the shaft manually to check for any resistance. If there is a significant amount of ice on the motor, defrost your freezer and see if that resolves the issue. You should also inspect the motor for any signs of wear or damage. If you cannot turn it easily, or if it is noticeably worn, you need a replacement evaporator fan motor.
       -- Electronic Control Board: Some newer models of refrigerators may use an electronic control board. Thermistors or temperature sensors are connected to the control board and are used to monitor temperatures in the fresh food and freezer compartments. The control board uses this information to control the operation of the compressor, fan motors and defrost system. If the temperatures are too warm, then the electronic control could be at fault. Electronic controls are complex and expensive and usually reliable, so you should first verify that all of the other components such as the compressor, fans and sensors are operating properly before condemning the control. Some manufacturers may provide specific information that will help in diagnosing a defective control.  How to inspect your refrigerator's electronic control board: Unplug your fridge before beginning as you will be handling electrical components. Locate and remove the electronic control board from your appliance. It is inside of the refrigerator, inside of the control box, which is usually found attached to the top or side of the fridge. Inspect your control board for any signs of damaged foil, wear, burnt connections, arcing, or any other damage. If you find any of the above, you need a replacement electronic control board.
       -- Temperature Sensor Or Thermistor: In models that use an Electronic Control, a thermistor or temperature sensor may be used to monitor fresh food and freezer temperatures. The sensor is a small capsule like device that is protected by a plastic shield and will vary in resistance depending on the temperature. The control board uses this information to turn on the compressor and fan circuits as well as to operate the damper control on some models. If a sensor becomes damaged or defective it may incorrectly signal the control board to turn off the compressor and fans and result in warmer than normal fresh food and freezer temperatures. Individual manufacturers may have specific information available to test these sensors, depending on the model involved, and may also provide a fault code on the electronic control board on some models.  How to test a refrigerator temperature sensor or thermistor with a multi-meter: Begin by unplugging your refrigerator, then remove the back panel of your refrigerator to locate the main control board. The thermistor(s) will be connected to the main control board. Remove the thermistor(s) from the appliance in order to test them. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes in order to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F. The thermistor(s) will produce different readings at different temperatures, and the suggested ranges below only apply to thermistors at a temperature of 32 degrees F. With the probes on the terminals and your multi-meter set to Rx1, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent). If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor.
       -- Defrost Timer: The defrost timer is an electro-mechanical timer that operates a set of contacts that control both the compressor circuit as well as the defrost heater circuit. Most timers will activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost timer will normally terminate the defrost cycle after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again.  How to test a refrigerator defrost timer with a multi-meter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source and locate your defrost timer. It can be located behind the refrigerator's lower kickplate, in the refrigerator's control panel, or even behind the refrigerator on its back wall. After locating it, remove the defrost timer from the appliance in order to test it Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, with one probe touching the common terminal (it should be labeled "3" or "C"), touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals, one at a time. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. If you do not receive these readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer.
       -- Defrost Thermostat: The defrost thermostat is a safety thermostat in series with the defrost heater and is used to terminate the defrost cycle when the evaporator reaches a specific temperature, usually rated at 38° to 47° Fahrenheit. If the thermostat is defective and remains open circuit, then the defrost heater will not be energized and no defrosting will take place.  How to test a refrigerator's defrost thermostat with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator and locate your refrigerator's defrost thermostat. In freezer-on-top models, it may be located under the floor of the unit, or it could be found at the back of the freezer. If you have a side-by-side refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is found at the back of the freezer side.  Once you have located it, remove the defrost thermostat in order to test it. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting. Place each of the probes on a thermostat wire. When your thermostat is cold, it should produce a reading of zero on your multi-meter. If it is warm (anywhere from forty to ninety degrees Fahrenheit), then this test should produce a reading of infinity.  If the results you receive from your test differ from the ones presented here, then you will need a replacement defrost thermostat.
       -- Defrost Heater: The defrost heater is the device that melts the ice and frost from the evaporator coils. It is typically a wire filament contained in a glass or aluminum tube. There may be more than one heater depending on the shape of the evaporator.  How to test a refrigerator defrost heater with a multi-meter: Ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning.  Locate your defrost heater. It can be located behind the back panel of the freezer section of your refrigerator, or under the floor of your refrigerator's freezer section. Defrost heaters are commonly located beneath a refrigerator's evaporator coils. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel.  Before you can test your defrost heater, you must remove it from your refrigerator. A defrost heater is connected by two wires, and the wires are connected with slip-on connectors. Firmly grasp these connectors and pull them off the terminals. You may need a pair of needle-nosed pliers to help you. Do not pull on the wires themselves.  Use your multi-meter to test the heater for continuity. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 scale and place the tester's leads on one terminal each. This should produce a reading anywhere in between zero and infinity. If you receive a reading of zero or infinity, you will need a replacement defrost heater.
       -- Condenser Fan Motor: Most modern frost-free refrigerators will have a fan cooled condenser coil. This normally located near the compressor at the bottom rear of the refrigerator. The condenser fan circulates air through the condenser coil to remove heat. If the refrigerator is warmer than normal and the compressor is running almost continuously, then you may have a problem with the condenser fan motor. The condenser fan motor runs at the same time as the evaporator motor and the compressor. If the fan motor is not turning at all the condenser will not be able to expel the excess heat and the compressor will run almost continuously  How to inspect a refrigerator condenser fan motor: Begin by unplugging your refrigerator from the power source and then remove the rear access panel to locate the condenser fan motor, it is usually found at the bottom rear of the appliance.  Once you have located it, Look for any debris or obstructions that could be preventing the fan from moving freely. You should also inspect the condenser fan motor for any signs of wear or damage.. If the fan motor is seized or worn, you will need a replacement condenser fan motor.
   - Fridge too warm
   - Causes
       -- Air Inlet Damper Or Baffle: The air damper, baffle or diffuser is the device that balances the air flow from the evaporator fan housing. This normally is a mechanically controlled baffle or flapper that controls the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the baffle is damaged or the linkage to the control knob is damaged, then you may not have enough cold air entering the fresh food compartment resulting in higher than normal temperatures.  How to inspect a refrigerator's air inlet damper or baffle: Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and open your refrigerator door to locate the damper or baffle. It will be found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment.  The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage. Care should be used when inspecting the housing to avoid damage to the seal or the Styrofoam.  Some refrigerator models use a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control that will automatically adjust the control for changes in the interior temperature. Make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and is not damaged. Attempt to operate the control knob to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely. If the damper/baffle is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle. 
   - Leaking
   - Causes
       -- Door Gaskets Or Seals: Door gaskets or seals are found along the outside of the refrigerator's doors. They are normally made from a vinyl material and will typically have a flexible magnetic strip inside to adhere to the cabinet when the door is closed to create an airtight seal. If there is moisture along the edge of the door then inspect the gaskets for distortion or damage. Air leakage through a defective gasket will create excessive moisture in the refrigerator, possibly resulting in defrost issues and potential water leaks.  How to inspect refrigerator door gaskets or seals: After unplugging your refrigerator, open the fridge and freezer doors to inspect the door gaskets or seals. You are looking for any discoloration, mold, wear, missing pieces, or anything else that may prevent a proper seal. If you find any of the above, you will need replacement gaskets or seals.
       -- Water Inlet Valve: The water inlet valve is a solenoid-operated device that connects your household water supply line to your refrigerator if you have an ice maker or water dispenser. When activated, it diverts water from the supply line to the dispenser or to fill your ice maker.  How to check the water inlet valve in a refrigerator with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator, disconnect the water supply and locate your water inlet valve. It is usually on the rear of the fridge, near the bottom. You will need to remove the rear panel to access it. Inspect the valve inlet supply connections for leaks and tighten or replace the connectors. You should also inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage. Check the outlet tubing for cracks or abrasions that may also create a leak and replace any cracked or brittle tubing and connectors. If none of the above appear to be the cause of the leak, remove the water inlet valve from the unit. Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test your valve for conitniuty by placing the probes on the valve's terminals. You should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.
       -- Ice Maker Assembly: If your fridge is leaking water from in or around the ice maker, you're probably also experiencing problems with the ice distribution itself. The cubes may be too small, one solid block of ice or not being produced at all. Inspect the ice maker mold to see if there are ice cubes present. If there are no cubes or very small cubes, then you should look for issues with the water fill system.  How to inspect a refrigerator's ice maker assembly: Disconnect your appliance from both the power source and water source. Inspect the fill tube and the fill cup area at the back of the icemaker to make sure that they are not frozen. If there is an ice buildup in that area, confirm no foreign objects have disrupted the flow of water into the fill cup.  Inspect the outlet tubing from the fill valve to the ice maker fill tube for any signs of restrictions. If any issues are found while performing the checks above, you will may a replacement ice maker assembly. If nothing obvious has caused the ice buildup, then suspect the inlet valve or tubing.
   - Fridge too cold
   - Causes
       -- Air Inlet Damper Or Baffle: The air damper, baffle or diffuser is the device that balances the air flow from the evaporator fan housing. This normally is a mechanically controlled baffle or flapper that controls the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the baffle is damaged or the linkage to the control knob is damaged, then too much cold air may enter the fresh food compartment resulting in lower than normal temperatures. The baffle or damper will be located where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment. The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage.  How to inspect a refrigerator's air inlet damper or baffle: Unplug your refrigerator and locate the damper or baffle. It is usually found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment. Use caution when inspecting the baffle or damper to not damage the plastic & Styrofoam housing that the baffle or damper is encased in. If your model of has a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and not damaged. The control knob should move freely, try to move it to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely. If the damper/baffle is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle. 
       -- Temperature Sensor Or Thermistor: Some electronic controls models will use a thermistor to sense the temperature. The electronic control monitors this temperature and will automatically adjust the damper. The temperature sensor is normally a plastic encased capsule with two wires attached and may be located near the air inlet. The thermistor will have a specific resistance based on temperature and is therefore difficult to diagnose without the manufacturer's specifications. Some models may indicate a fault code when the sensor is faulty.  How to test a refrigerator temperature sensor or thermistor with a multi-meter: Verify that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source as you will be inspecting electrical components. The thermistor(s) will be connected to the main control board, you will need to remove the back panel of your fridge to access the control board. Remove the thermistor(s) from the appliance in order to test them. Thermistor(s) will produce different multi-meter readings based on their temperature when you test them. The ranges below only apply to thermistors at 32 degrees F. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent). If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor.
       -- Main Control Board: Some newer models may have an electronic control board that controls all of the refrigerators functions. Sensors are connected to the board that monitor fresh food and freezer compartment temperatures and the control board will use that information to operate the compressor and fans as well as the defrost system and in some cases the air baffle/damper to balance temperatures. A defective control board could cause a symptom of the fresh food compartment being too cold, but you should first eliminate the sensors and the damper before changing the control. Some manufacturers may provide detailed information on the procedure for testing the board and the sensors.  How to inspect a refrigerator's main control board: Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source, you will be inspecting electrical components. The main control board is usually found inside the control box, which is inside the fridge, attached to the top or side of the fridge. Locate and remove the main control board from your appliance. Looking for any signs of damaged foil, wear, burnt connections, arcing, or any other damage, inspect your main control board. If you find any of the above, you need a replacement main control board.
       -- Cold Control Or Temperature Control: The cold control thermostat monitors the temperature inside the refrigerator and will operate the compressor and fans when the temperature rises. The control is often labeled as the refrigerator control but in some models may be called the freezer control. The control will have wires attached to it that operate the compressor circuit and will normally have an "off" setting on the knob. If the control is defective it may create a symptom of the fresh food section being too cold but would also lower the temperature in the freezer compartment as well, and the compressor would run longer than normal. Try adjusting both controls starting at the middle settings and monitor the temperatures for 24 hours before making any further adjustments.  How to test your fridge's cold control & temperature control with a multi-meter: You will be handling electrical components, ensure you have disconnected the power source from your appliance before beginning. Begin by locating your control, it will be inside the fridge, usually in the fresh food section control panel, likely located directly behind the temperature adjustment knob. After locating it, remove the control from the fridge, set the control to the lowest (warmest) setting, place your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, and touch the probes to the terminals to test for continuity. You should receive a reading of infinity. While still touching the terminals with the probes, change the control to a colder (higher) setting. This should change the reading from infinity to zero. If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control.
   - Fridge runs too long
   - Causes
       -- Defrost Timer: The defrost timer can be either a mechanical timer or an electronic "adaptive defrost control". Both are used to initiate the defrost cycle by turning on the defrost heater at specific intervals and for a specific amount of time. Mechanical timers are more common and usually activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost cycle will normally terminate after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again. Adaptive defrost controls will monitor ambient conditions and previous defrost cycles and adapt the defrost cycle frequency and length to be more efficient.  How to test a refrigerator defrost timer with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator before beginning. Locate & remove the defrost timer from the appliance in order to test it. It can be found behind the refrigerator's lower kickplate, in the refrigerator's control panel, or even behind the refrigerator on its back wall. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch one probe to the common terminal (it should be labeled "3" or "C"). One at a time, touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. If you receive different readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer.
       -- Defrost Heater: The defrost heater is controlled by the defrost timer or adaptive defrost control and the defrost termination thermostat. The heater is normally a glass encased heater wire with well insulated wire leads.  How to test a refrigerator defrost heater with a multi-meter: Unplug your refrigerator before starting, you will be inspecting electrical components. Remove your defrost heater. Defrost heaters are commonly located beneath a refrigerator's evaporator coils. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way such as shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel(s). The defrost heater will have two wires connected to it, carefully grasp the metal connectors to remove them, do not pull the wires themselves. With your multi-meter set onto Rx1 mode, place the probes onto the terminals of the defrost heater. You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading between zero and infinity. If you receive a reading of zero or infinity, you will need a replacement defrost heater.
       -- Defrost Termination Thermostat: The defrost termination thermostat is used as a safety device to turn off the defrost heater when the temperature reaches a specific limit. The thermostat is normally wired in series with the defrost element and is normally open circuit above 35°- 47° Fahrenheit. For this reason it is sometimes difficult to check the continuity of the thermostat unless you are sure that the temperature is low enough to close the circuit. Newer style thermostats may have an internal bias resistor to aid in testing both the thermostat and the heater. The wiring diagram will normally indicate this.  How to test a refrigerator's defrost thermostat with a multi-meter: Because you will be testing electrical components, ensure you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning.   Locate and remove the defrost thermostat in order to test it. In freezer-on-top models, it may be located under the floor of the unit, or it could be found at the back of the freezer. If you have a side-by-side refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is found at the back of the freezer side. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way, such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel.  With your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to a thermostat wire. When your thermostat is cold, it should produce a reading of zero on your multi-meter. If it is warm (anywhere from forty to ninety degrees Fahrenheit), then this test should produce a reading of infinity.  If your tests produce different results, then you will need a replacement defrost thermostat.
       -- Fresh & Freezer Door Gaskets: Leaky or damaged door seals can create long run times but normally will just create excess moisture that is visible near the air outlet ducts or on shelves in the freezer. Moisture along the edge of the door is also a good indication that the gaskets are not sealing properly and should be replaced.  How to inspect refrigerator door gaskets: At various points around the fridge, place a piece of paper on the seal and close the door normally. With the door closed, slide the paper out. If you can slide the paper out without any resistance, then you will need a replacement fresh food & freezer door gasket(s).
       -- Condenser Fan Motor: If your fridge sounds like it's running more often than normal, the condenser fan motor could be to blame. If the condenser cannot expel heat efficiently, then the compressor and sealed system work harder to keep the refrigerator cold. Check for higher than normal surface temperatures on the cabinet between the fresh food and freezer doors as this area contains tubing attached to the condenser and will heat up if the condenser cannot be cooled fast enough.  How to inspect a refrigerator condenser fan motor: Before beginning, ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source, and then locate the condenser fan motor. You will need to remove the rear access panel to find it, it should be near the compressor.  If the fan motor is seized or worn, you will need a replacement condenser fan motor.
       -- Evaporator Fan Motor: The evaporator fan is used to draw air over the evaporator coil and circulate the cold air throughout the fresh food and freezer compartments. If the evaporator fan does not work then the control thermostat or sensor may not correctly sense the temperature and the compressor will continue to run longer than normal. The fresh food and freezer compartment temperatures will increase as well.  How to inspect a refrigerator evaporator fan motor:  Because you will be inspecting electrical components, ensure you have unplugged your appliance before beginning. Locate the evaporator fan motor, it will be behind the evaporator fan cover, inside the freezer compartment. If you notice a large amount of ice has built up on or around the motor, allow your freezer to defrost and see if that resolves the issue. Attempt to manually turn the motor shaft, it should turn freely with minimal resistance. You should also inspect the fan and motor for any signs of wear or damage, removing any foreign objects in the area. If it is noticeably worn, or if it is seized, you need a replacement evaporator fan motor.
       -- Sealed System: The sealed system in a refrigerator is comprised of the evaporator, the condenser and the compressor and the associated tubing. A defect in any of these components can cause a symptom of running too long or not cooling enough, and would have to be tested and/or serviced by a qualified refrigeration technician as it involves live voltage tests.
   - Door Sweating
   - Causes
       -- Fresh Food & Freezer Door Gasket: Leaky or damaged door seals can create excess moisture that is visible near the air outlet ducts or on shelves in the freezer. Damaged gaskets can also prevent doors from closing properly and may introduce enough moisture into the refrigerator that defrost issues may occur. Moisture along the edge of the door is a good indication that the gaskets are not sealing properly and should be replaced.  How to inspect refrigerator door gaskets: Take a piece of paper, and place it at various points along the door. Close the door normally and slide the paper out. If the paper slides out without any resistance, then you will need replacement fresh food & freezer door gasket(s).
       -- Dispenser Door Assembly or Flapper & Ice Door Kit: When activated, the ice dispenser door opens so that ice can be dispensed from the icemaker. The door or flapper is normally spring loaded and will have a vinyl or foam rubber seal attached to prevent room air from entering the refrigerator. If there is moisture around the front of the dispenser or if there is signs of moisture in the ice bin area, then this would indicate that the door is not closing completely. The flapper door is hinged and is normally operated by a solenoid with a return spring and often with a damper to slow the closing action to prevent the door from closing on an ice cube.  How to inspect a refrigerator dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit: Remove the dispenser cover in order to inspect its components. You should inspect the following parts for damage or wear.	Door hinges.	Door seal.	Door pivot mechanism.	Return spring.	Solenoid plunger and linkage.	Damper. If you find any issues while checking the above parts, you may need a replacement dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit. 
       -- Door Closure Cam Kit: In some models of side-by-side refrigerators, closer cams on the lower door hinges are used to assist in closing the doors. The cams are made of hard plastic or nylon and have sloped shoulders on them that mate together. One cam is mounted to the bottom of the door and the other is mounted to the top of the hinge. When the door is opened, the door cam rotates up out of the hinge cam, lifting the door up and a detent allows it to stay in an open position. When closing the door, the weight of the door forces the door to pivot closed as the cams mate together. If either of these cams is broken, then the door may not close tightly. This would allow warm outside air to enter the refrigerator and cause condensation to form.  How to inspect your refrigerator's door closure cam kit: Open your refrigerator door and locate the closer cams. Visually inspect the closer cams to verify that they are not cracked, worn, or otherwise damaged. If they are damaged, you will need a replacement closure cam kit.
       -- Door Hinge & Bearing: Fresh food and freezer doors rotate on hinges. The hinges act as bearings and the doors should pivot easily on them. If the hinges become worn or dry of lubricant, they may prevent the doors from closing completely. This could allow room air into the refrigerator and cause moisture problems. A common symptom of a faulty hinge bearing is when opening or closing the door a thumping and/or scraping noise can be heard.  How to check your refrigerator's door hinge & bearings: Open and remove your refrigerator door in order to locate the hinge & bearing. Inspect the hinges for any signs of cracking or damage. If they are not damaged, lubricate the hinges with a food safe grease to see if that resolves the issue. If they are damaged or greasing the hinges does not solve the issue, you need replacement door hinges & bearings.
   - Freezer too cold
   - Causes
       -- Air Damper Or Freezer Control: If the freezer section is too cold and the fresh food section temperature is normal you should suspect that the air damper or freezer control is adjusted improperly or may be defective, and is deflecting more than the normal amount of air into the freezer section and not enough into the fresh food compartment to satisfy the cold control and turn off the compressor.   How to inspect a refrigerator's air damper or freezer control: Unplug your refrigerator before beginning. Locate your air damper or freezer control. It will usually be found in the fresh food compartment, behind a vent found on the top or side of the fridge. Remove the vent and inspect the damper flap for any signs of wear or damage, attempt to manually move the flap. You should feel little or no resistance. If you find any issues when performing the above checks, you will need a replacement air damper or freezer control. If you do not find the issue, suspect the evaporator coils or motor.
       -- Temperature Sensor Or Thermistor: In models that use an Electronic Control, a thermistor or temperature sensor may be used to monitor fresh food and freezer temperatures. The control board uses this information to turn on the compressor and fan circuits as well as to operate the damper control on some models. If the sensor becomes damaged or defective it may incorrectly signal the control board to close the air damper too much and result in colder than normal freezer temperatures. Individual manufacturers may have specific information available to test these sensors, depending on the model involved, and may also provide a fault code on the electronic control board on some models.  How to test a refrigerator temperature sensor or thermistor with a multi-meter: Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and then remove the back panel of your refrigerator to locate the main control board. Locate and remove the thermistor(s), they will be attached to the main control board. Place the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes before testing. The amount of resistance in a thermistor varies based on what their surface temperature is when they are measured. The range below only applies to thermistors measured at 32 degrees F. Using a multi-meter on Rx1 mode, touch the terminals with the meter's probes. The test should produce a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent). If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor.
   - Not dispensing water
   - Causes
       -- Ice & Water Filter: If so equipped, the ice and water filter in your refrigerator is responsible for removing any debris or contaminants from your water that may remain after local water treatment. Most filters contain and are made up of carbon and a fabric filter. Over time the filter may become restricted and reduce or stop the water flow to the dispenser. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.  How to inspect your refrigerator's ice and water filter:  Consider when you last changed your ice and water filter. How frequently you need to change your filter varies by model and local water conditions, but you should never exceed 12 months of use per filter. Find and remove your water filter. The exact location differs from model to model, but it is commonly located in the water line leading to the fridge, behind the base grill, or inside the unit attached to the rear corner or ceiling. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to disconnect the water supply before beginning. With the variety of locations and removal instructions, we recommend you follow brand specific directions, or refer to your owner's manual for specific directions. Take note of the installation date on your calendar before installing the new filter. If your filter is damaged or clogged, or if you have exceeded the manufacturers' recommended guidelines, you will need a replacement ice and water filter.  
       -- Water Inlet Valve: The water inlet valve is a solenoid-operated device that supplies water to the dispenser when activated. When water is selected at the dispenser control panel, line voltage is supplied to the solenoid of the water inlet valve to allow water to flow. Verify that you have adequate pressure at the inlet to the valve, that the inlet screen is not plugged and that there are no restrictions in the inlet or outlet tubing.  How to test your refrigerator's water inlet valve with a multi-meter: After disconnecting the water supply and unplugging your refrigerator, remove the rear access panel and locate the water inlet valve.

       -- Membrane Switch: If the buttons on your microwave touchpad do not work, it may be an issue with the membrane switch. This part is made up of soft-touch electrical switches, which are two layers of Mylar plastic with conductive coatings on the sides that face each other. When you press a key on your microwave touchpad, the two surfaces come in contact and complete an electrical circuit which sends a signal to the control board. The conductive coating on your membrane switch will wear out over time through repeated use, and need to be replaced.  How to test a microwave membrane switch with a multimeter: Unplug your microwave before beginning this test. Locate the membrane switch in order to test it. You will need to remove the cabinet in order to access the membrane switch, which is usually attached to the control board by a flat ribbon connector. After referring to the electrical schematic of your microwave to determine the matrix layout of the membrane switch, test the touchpad with a multimeter. There should be a few ohms of resistance when you test each key on the touchpad. If your test results indicate one or more keys are defective, you will need a replacement membrane switch. 
       -- Control Board: If you cannot key in numbers on your microwave touchpad but the display is still lighting up, it may be an issue with the control board. The control board supplies the touchpad with low voltage signals. When you press a button on your microwave touchpad, the control board sends a signal to the other microwave components to begin heating. If the membrane switch is functioning as usual, and the connection to the control board looks fine, then the control board likely needs to be replaced. How to inspect a microwave control board: Before beginning this or any other inspection, disconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate your control board. You will need to remove all or part of the cabinet in order to access it. Once you have found it, looking for any signs of damage or burning, visually inspect your control board. If you find any issues while inspecting it, or if you have ruled out the other causes mentioned above, you will need a replacement control board.
   - Door not closing properly
   - Causes
       -- Door Latch Assembly: If your microwave door won't close or won't latch, it usually means there is an issue with the door latch assembly. The latch assembly typically has two hooks which link to the switch holder on the frame of the microwave. When the hooks work properly, they engage the switches to begin powering the microwave, so having them in working order is important. The latch assembly is spring-loaded to provide the necessary tension to engage the hooks.

How to inspect a microwave door latch lever or button: To ensure your safety, unplug the appliance before beginning. Remove the control panel and button cover in order to access the door latch lever. Once you have access to it, visually inspect the lever for damage, wear, or seized components. If you find any issues during your inspection, you will need a replacement door latch lever.
   - No heat
   - Causes
       -- High Voltage Diode: Your microwave may turn on but not heat up. This could be caused by a problem with the high voltage diode, which helps to power the magnetron.  How to test a microwave high voltage diode with a multimeter. Unplug your microwave before beginning this inspection. Locate and remove your high voltage diode to test it for continuity. To access it, you will first need to remove the cabinet and discharge the high voltage capacitor. Set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the terminals. Next, reverse the probes to check for continuity in the other direction. You should receive a reading that shows continuity in one direction, but not the other direction. If your diode does not show continuity, or shows continuity in both directions, you will need a replacement high voltage diode.
       -- Door Switch: When your microwave turns on but does not heat up, it may mean the door switch is broken. The door switch signals other microwave components to supply power when closed, and to stop heating when open. The door switch can also be called an interlock switch. When this part doesn't work, the fan and stirrer motors may still function, which makes your microwave look like it is working.  How to test a microwave door switch with a multimeter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source. Begin by verifying that the door hooks trigger the door switch mechanically. If they do, remove your microwave's cabinet, locate your door switch, and remove it in order to test it for continuity. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, while depressing the actuator button, touch the probes to the switch's terminals. This test should produce a reading of 0, which indicates there is continuity. If your test results do not match the results above, you will need a replacement door switch.
       -- Magnetron: A microwave that does not heat up may have a broken magnetron. This is the part that makes the heat to cook the food. If it is broken, it may blow a fuse in your microwave which could lead to other components failing. How to test microwave magnetron with a multimeter: Before beginning this inspection, verify that you have disconnected the appliance from the power source. In order to access the magnetron, you will need to remove the appliance's cabinet. Next, discharge the high voltage capacitor, then verify that the high voltage diode is working and that the mounting bolts are tight. Remove the magnetron to test it if no other issues are found. Using a multimeter on Rx1, touch the probes to the terminals, this should produce a reading of two to three ohms of resistance. Next, move one probe to touch the metal housing of the magnetron. This test shouldn't indicate that continuity is present. If the results of your test do not match the results above, you will need a replacement magnetron.
   - Sparking
   - Causes
       -- High Voltage Diode: If there are sparks inside your microwave while it is running, the high voltage diode may be shorted or opened. The diode working alongside the capacitor and the magneton to provide the heat the microwave needs to work. How to test a microwave high voltage diode with a multimeter. Disconnect your appliance from the power source; you will be handling electrical components. Remove the cabinet and discharge the high voltage capacitor to avoid getting an electrical shock. Next, locate and remove the high voltage diode in order to test it for continuity. You will need to check for continuity in both directions. Begin by setting your multimeter to Rx1 and touching the probes to the terminals. Next, reverse the probes in order to check for continuity in the opposite direction. You should find that there is continuity in one direction, but not both directions. If the results of your test show that there is continuity in both directions, or that there is no continuity in either direction, you will need a replacement high voltage diode.
       -- Stirrer: The stirrer helps ensure there is even heating inside your microwave. The stirrer helps to evenly distribute the energy your appliance is creating. If the stirrer in your microwave is not working properly and energy is concentrating in one area of your microwave, instead of distributing evenly throughout the unit, it can lead to burning and sparking. There are two reasons why your stirrer would not be working: either the drive motor is broken, or the stirrer belt is broken. How to inspect a microwave stirrer belt: Before beginning, ensure you disconnect your appliance from the power source. In order to access the stirrer belt, you will first need to remove the outer cabinet. Locate your stirrer belt in order to inspect it. It will most likely be found at the very top of the appliance. Examine the area around the belt to identify if there are any objects blocking its movement. Next, verify that the belt is correctly installed, often just a small adjustment is needed. Finally, visually inspect your belt for any signs of fraying, cracking, burning, or other damage. If you identify any issues during your inspection, you will need a replacement stirrer belt.
   - Won't turn on
   - Causes
       -- Door Switch: There are many reasons your microwave won't turn on, one of which might be a faulty door switch. The door switch, also known as an interlock switch, signals other microwave components to begin powering when the door is closed, and to stop when the door opens. For this reason, everything else may appear in working order but the microwave will not begin heating. How to test a microwave door switch with a multimeter: As you will be testing electrical components, verify that you have unplugged your microwave before beginning. Locate and remove the door switch. You will need to remove the cabinet in order to access it. You should also inspect the door hooks that trigger the door switch to verify they are activating the switch mechanically To test the switch for continuity, set your multimeter to Rx1, depress the actuator button and touch the terminals with the probes. You should receive a reading of 0, indicating that there is continuity. If your switch does not have continuity between the terminals, you will need a replacement door switch.
       -- Ceramic Fuse: If your microwave won't start and the display is blank and unresponsive, the issue may be with the ceramic fuse. This part protects other microwave components from power fluctuations, and causes a complete loss of power when it fails, meaning your microwave won't work. If you are aware of the cause of the fuse failure, such as opening or closing the microwave door, you can also test the door switch to see if that is working. If you are unaware of the reason for the fuse failure, you may want to test other microwave parts such as the magnetron, high voltage diode, capacitor, and transformer.  How to test a microwave ceramic fuse with a multimeter: Unplug your microwave before starting this test. The ceramic fuse will be found near the power cord. Remove the microwave's cabinet, locate the fuse, and remove it in order to test it for continuity. Set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the fuse's terminals. This test should produce a reading of 0, showing that there is continuity between the terminals. If your test produces a different reading, you will need a replacement ceramic fuse.
       -- Thermal Fuse or Cut Out: A problem with the thermal fuse or cut out could be the reason your microwave won't turn on. The thermal cut-outs, also known as thermal fuses, help keep the oven from overheating. When the thermal cut-outs fail, your microwave won't turn on as a safety precaution to keep it from getting too hot. Take this opportunity to also check that the cooling fan is working and not causing the microwave to overheat by cutting off airflow. How to test a microwave thermal fuse with a multimeter: Disconnect your appliance from the power source before attempting this inspection. Locate and remove the thermal fuse. You will need to remove the appliance's cabinet in order to access it and will need to disconnect the wires attached to the fuse in order to remove it. With the fuse removed from the appliance, set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting, and touch the probes to the terminals to test for continuity. A properly functioning thermal fuse should produce a reading of 0. If the results of your test differ from the above, you will need a replacement thermal fuse.
       -- Door Latch Assembly: Your microwave may not start because of an issue with the door latch assembly. Most door latch assemblies are made of plastic hooks that stick out of the door and engage the door switch when the door is closed, signaling the rest of the controls to power the microwave. How to inspect a microwave door latch assembly: As with most microwave inspections, begin by unplugging your appliance. The door latch assembly will be found attached to the door; you will need to remove the inner door panel in order to access it. To inspect it closely, remove it from the appliance. Looking for any signs of wear, discoloration, damage, or cracking, visually inspect the door latch assembly. If you find any issues while inspecting it, you will need a replacement door latch assembly.
Appliance: Air Conditioner
Symptoms:
   - Does not blow cold air
   - Causes
       -- Air Filter: Your window air conditioner may not be able to blow cold air if the air filter is clogged, restricting air flow. Air conditioners use a fan to circulate cold air over the evaporator coils and into your room; a clogged air filter impedes that air flow. If the air filter is dirty, the restricted air flow can cause a buildup of frost or ice on the coils, which can lead to other problems. You can usually locate the air filter behind the front grille. Clean the filter, or replace it if it is too dirty or damaged to function. Take this opportunity to also clean the fan blades and evaporator coils with soap, water, and a soft brush.
       -- Fan and Fan Motor: The reason your air conditioner is not cooling could be because of an issue with the fan or fan motor. In window air conditioner units, the fan helps circulate cool air over the evaporator coils and throughout your room. If the fan fails or is running slowly, the air won't flow properly, leading to a buildup of frost or ice on the coils. To access the fan and fan motor, remove the cabinet. Try turning the fan motor to see if it moves easily and freely. If the fan blades appear damaged, they will need to be replaced. If there is no apparent damage to the fan or fan motor, then live-voltage tests will need to be performed by a qualified technician.
       -- Temperature Control: If your air conditioner won't blow cold air, it could mean there is a problem with the temperature control or thermostat. This part monitors the room air temperature and signals the compressor to kick in if necessary. The temperature control often has a sensor bulb attached to it that will be located near the evaporator coils as well as electrical contacts for the compressor. The thermostat also signals the compressor to turn off when the ideal temperature is achieved. If the temperature control or thermostat has failed, it will not signal the compressor to cool the air properly. Check the sensor bulb for damage or kinks, and replace the control assembly if it is broken. If it has no outward signs of damage, rotate the dial to the lowest setting and test its continuity with a multi-meter. Be sure to check that the sensor bulb is positioned correctly before replacing the control.
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: Your air conditioner may not blow cold air because of an issue with the control board, also sometimes known as a PCB assembly. The control board works with the temperature sensor to signal the compressor to turn on according to the desired room temperature. If the control board is not working, it won't power the compressor to turn on and begin cooling air. First check the thermistor/temperature sensor for damage before concluding that the control board needs to be replaced.
       -- Capacitor: If your window air conditioner is not cooling, it could be due to an issue with the compressor circuit, specifically the capacitor. This part aids the compressor to start and blow cool air into the room. If the capacitor isn't working, the compressor will not start. To access the capacitor, remove the cabinet cover and inspect it for damage. If the capacitor isn't obviously damaged, a live-voltage test will need to be performed by a qualified technician. It is essential that the replacement capacitor conforms to the same specifications as the previous one.
       -- Thermistor: If your window air conditioner will not blow cold air, and you have already ruled out the air filter and fan motor for issues, the problem may be the thermistor. This part helps to control the temperature and signal the compressor to power on and begin cooling if necessary. The thermistor is typically located next to the evaporator coil. Locate the thermistor and check for signs of damage, replace it if necessary.
   - Does not shut off
   - Causes
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: If your air conditioner will not shut off and keeps blowing cold air, it may be due to an issue with the control board, also known as the PCB assembly. A sensor monitors the air temperature in the room and signals the control board to turn on the compressor and begin cooling. The board relays may be faulty if the compressor keeps running well after the ideal temperature has been reached. The board processor circuitry may also be the source of the issue. Some air conditioner units have a separate relay board, in which case you can use a multi-meter to test each relay output for continuity and determine if one is at fault.
       -- Temperature Control: You air conditioner may not shut off or stop blowing air because of an issue with the temperature control, also known as a thermostat. For rotary dial thermostats, there will be a set of internal electrical contracts which power the compressor circuit, to signal it to blow cold air. This set-up utilizes a sensor bulb, located near the evaporator coils, to monitor room air temperature. If the temperature control contacts become stuck in the closed position, the compressor will keep running after the ideal temperature has been reached, and keeps blowing cold air. Check the sensor bulb to make sure it is properly attached to the coils before replacing the temperature control.
       -- Thermistor or Temperature Sensor: If your window air conditioner will not shut off, it may be due to a problem with the thermistor or temperature sensor. The thermistor is located near the evaporator and monitors the air temperature in the room. It signals the control board to turn the compressor on or off as required. The temperature sensor or thermistor may not be working if the air conditioner is not shutting off, because it isn't getting the message that ideal temperature has been reached. To test the sensor, check your manual to find the exact specifications for the thermistor and measure with a multi-meter. Check the other components such as the control board for any visual signs of a loose connection.
   - Does not turn on
   - Causes
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: If your air conditioner will not turn on and you have confirmed that the power source is good, the problem may be the electronic control board, also known as a PCB assembly. This part is commonly used in window air conditioner units to help control the various parts. A sign that the control board is not working is the fan or compressor circuits not turning on. Check the control board for a blown fuse, first consulting your user manual to ensure your control board has an internal fuse. Replace your control board with a board with the same specifications.
       -- Thermostat or Temperature Control: If your air conditioner does not turn on, there may be an issue with the thermostat or temperature control. This is especially common in models which have a rotary type thermostat or control, which utilizes a sensing bulb to monitor the air temperature in your room. If the air needs cooling, the sensing bulb will signal the compressor. First check that the power source to your air conditioner unit is good, then try to turn the temperature control, which should trigger a light click noise. If everything appears normal, you can test the thermostat contacts for continuity using a multi-meter.
       -- Power Cord: Your air conditioner may not turn on because of a faulty power cord interrupting the power supply. Test the outlet you are using with a different appliance to make sure it is supplying power. Visually inspect the power cord for signs of damage such as fraying. If your window air conditioner is on the newer side, it should feature a circuit breaker in the power cord; check to see if the breaker has tripped. If everything appears normal, remove the cabinet and use a multi-meter to test the terminal strip for voltage. Do not attempt to repair the power cord, replace it if it is faulty.
       -- Thermistor or Temperature Sensor: If your window air conditioner won't turn on, there may be a problem with the thermistor or temperature sensor. This component, particularly common in newer models, helps control the function of other air conditioner parts. The thermistor acts as a sensor to help monitor the air temperature in the room and signals the control board to turn the compressor on and begin circulating cool air. To test the thermistor, check your user manual to find out the proper specifications, and then use a multi-meter to confirm if it is working. If the thermistor appears to be working, inspect the control board for damage or a loose connection.
       -- Fuse: Your window air conditioner may not turn on because of a blown fuse. The fuse, particularly common in newer models, helps protect the electronic control. Check to ensure that the power supply to your unit is good, then unplug the air conditioner and remove the cabinet cover. The fuse will be located near the circuit board; check to see if it has blown, using a multi-meter if necessary. Replace the fuse if it has blown.
   - Unit is on but no air blowing
   - Causes
       -- Fan and Fan Motor: If your window air condition turns on but won't blow cold air, the issue could be with the fan or fan motor not spinning. The fan draws air from the room over the cold evaporator coils, and then blows the cooled air into the room. No cold air coming from the air conditioner can mean the circulating fan is running too slow or not at all. A side effect of a broken fan is that the evaporator coils can frost over without the necessary air flow. Remove the cabinet to inspect the fan and fan motor. Check the fan blades for damage, and make sure no objects are keeping them from rotating. Check to see if the fan blades and motor turn easily, if not they need to be replaced. If the fan and fan motor appear to be in working order, there may be another issue that can be detected by testing the parts with a multi-meter, however those tests should only be performed by a qualified person.
       -- Fan Motor Capacitor: Your window air conditioner may turn on but not blow cold air because of an issue with the fan motor capacitor. This part aids the fan motor in circulating cold air. If the motor is making a humming noise or turning very slowly, the capacitor may need to be replaced. These parts are located within the air conditioner cabinet. Remove the cabinet cover and check that the motor and fan can rotate easily, without any foreign objects blowing them. Also check the wires for any signs of wear, burning, or other damage. If the capacitor is not obviously damaged, it should be tested by a qualified technician.
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: Your air conditioner may turn on but now blow cold air if the control board, also known as the PCB assembly, is not working properly. The control board helps to power the fan motor and compressor circuits to circulate cooled air. The control board relays can be tested for functionality with a multi-meter, but only by a qualified person. A defective relay or circuitry component means the control board should be replaced.
       -- Air Filter: If your window air conditioner is on but won't blow cold air, it could be as simple as a clogged air filter. The air filter catches particles from the fan before they can be circulated into your home with the cold air. After a buildup of dust, dirt, and other particles, the filter becomes too clogged to function, restricting air flow and keeping the other parts from working to circulate cold air. The air filter is located near the evaporator and front grille. Replace the air filter, and also take this opportunity to clean off the evaporator coils if you notice a buildup of dust and dirt. Simply use water, soap, and a soft brush to clean then off.
   - Coils icing over
   - Causes
       -- Air Filter: Your air conditioner coils may be icing up because of inadequate air flow, stemming from a dirty or clogged air filter. Air from the room flows over the evaporator coils to be cooled and then back into the room. If the air flow is restricted, it can lead to a frost or ice buildup over the coils. This problem will not sort itself out as the buildup of ice or frost will restrict the air flow even more. Replace the air filter in order to keep the air flowing properly. The filter is usually behind the front grille, and is held in place with plastic tabs.
       -- Temperature Control: If your air conditioner coils are icing up, there may be an issue with the temperature control or thermostat. This part monitors the room air temperature and signals the compressor to turn on to begin cooling if necessary. The temperature control will have a sensor bulb, located near the evaporator coils which helps monitor the air temperature. If the temperature control is not functioning properly, it can lead to the compressor running longer than is necessary and cooling the room below ideal temperature. At this point, the evaporator can no longer extract heat from the room which causes the coils to ice over. This is particularly common during periods of intense humidity. Check the sensor bulb for signs of damage such as cracks or bends, and correct placement within the evaporator coil system.
       -- Fan and Fan Motor: The reason your air conditioner coils are icing up could be inadequate air flow due to a faulty fan or fan motor. In window air conditioner units, the fan pulls air over the evaporator coils to cool it, and then blows it back throughout the room. If the fan is running slowly or not at all, the evaporator coils won't get enough air and become prone to freezing over. To access the fan and fan motor, unplug the unit and remove the cabinet cover. Try turning the motor manually to see if it rotates easily, and check the fan blades for signs of damage or foreign objects blocking it from turning. If everything appears normal, the fan motor may not be getting power and will need to be tested by a qualified technician.
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: If your air conditioner coils are icing up, and you have ruled out the air filter and fan motor as the source of the issue, it may be due to a faulty control board or PCB assembly. This part controls the fan motor and compressor circuits, and includes a sensor located near the evaporator coil and signals the compressor to turn on or off. If this sensor is faulty it can result in the compressor running continually and cooling the air to a point that causes the coils to ice or frost over. This is more prone to happen during times of intense humidity. Check the sensor to see if it is damaged before replacing the control board.
       -- Fan Motor Capacitor: The most likely reason your air conditioner coils are icing up is a lack of airflow due to a faulty fan motor capacitor. This part aids the fan in circulating cooled air throughout the room. A sign that the capacitor is not functioning is that the fan motor will make a humming noise or turn very slowly, resulting in restricted air flow and frosted coils. To inspect the capacitor, remove the cabinet cover. Check for signs of wear or damage, and replace the capacitor if it appears damaged.
   - Unusual noise
   - Causes
       -- Fan and Blower Wheel: An unusual noise coming from your window air conditioner could be caused by the fan. The fan pulls air through the filter and sends it over the evaporator coils to be cooled, before blowing the air back into your room. The motor shaft features an additional fan which helps cool the condenser coils as well. The unusual noise could be coming from either fan, especially if they have a bent blade, buildup of debris, or an imbalance. To check the fan blades, remove the fan cover and check for damage or foreign objects. You can also take this opportunity to clean the fan blades and condenser coils of any dust or dirt buildup. Inspect the fan filter as well to see if it needs changing. Some air conditioner models use the condenser fan blade to transfer excess drain water onto the condenser coils; if the drain port becomes clogged, the excess water can cause the unusual noise as the fan blades slosh through it. Drain the excess water and make sure the port is no longer plugged to clear up this problem.
       -- Fan Bearing: If your air conditioner is making an unusual noise such as buzzing or humming, it may be a problem with the fan bearing, which is a component of the blower wheel in air conditioners that feature a squirrel cage-style blower wheel. Remove the fan cover to get to the fan assembly, then remove the blower wheel and motor in order to replace this part.
       -- Fan Motor: If your air conditioner is making an unusual, high-pitched squeaking noise, it could mean there is a problem with the fan motor. Window units typically have a double shaft fan motor with two fan blades which work in tandem to distribute cold air over the condenser coils. The fan motor bearings and/or bushings can become worn over time and cause the unusual noise. They can also become worn if the blower wheel is unbalanced, which happens when there is a buildup of dirt because the air filter has not been changed. When the fan motor becomes noisy on a window air conditioner unit, it means it needs to be replaced.
       -- Spring Clamp: If you have a noisy air conditioner, the issue could simply be a loose fan blade. The two fan blades will normally be attached to the fan motor shaft with spring clamps. Remove the fan cover to inspect the clamp, to see if it has come loose or is damaged. If so, it could be causing a clunking noise. Replace the spring clamp if it shows signs of damage. Take this opportunity to also inspect the fan blades for damage and clean them off.
Appliance: Dehumidifier
Symptoms:
   - Won't stay on
   - Causes
       -- Sensor: If your dehumidifier won't stay running, the issue may be with the humidity sensor. This dehumidifier part is used on electronic control models to detect the humidity level in the air, and signal the control board to turn on the compressor when necessary. If your dehumidifier keeps shutting off, the sensor may not be reading the humidity level correctly, resulting in the unit shutting off before reaching the desired level. Some dehumidifiers also have a thermistor that works with the sensor which can also be faulty. Check the connections of the control board and thermistor before replacing the sensor.
       -- Humidity Control or Humidistat: If your dehumidifier keeps shutting off, the issue may be with the humidity control or humidistat. This dehumidifier part detects the humidity level in the air and signals the compressor circuit to cycle on when necessary. If the humidity control is not reading the humidity level properly, it will signal the compressor to shut off before the desired level is reached. In order to complete this dehumidifier repair, you would need to test the control with a hygrometer which is not a common tool to have on hand. Having to set the control to a lower setting in order to reach the desired humidity level is a sign that the humidistat is defective and needs to be replaced.
       -- Other Parts: If your dehumidifier keeps shutting off, there could be a problem with the controls, and parts that relate to the bucket full light. If this light is on and the bucket is empty, the unit will turn off. Consult our repair section for this problem for more information on why your dehumidifier won't stay running.
   - Unit says bucket is full when it isn't
   - Causes
       -- Sensor Assembly: If the bucket full light stays on when the bucket is empty, there may be an issue with the sensor assembly, which is the dehumidifier part that monitors the humidity and evaporator temperature. On electronic control models, the sensor assembly tells the control when to begin the compressor cycle, when the fan motor should turn on and off, and when a defrosting cycle is needed. When the sensor assembly fails, the bucket full light stays on. To troubleshoot the dehumidifier, use process of elimination to find out which part has failed. If the float assembly and float switch are working normally, it is likely that the sensor assembly is faulty and needs to be replaced.
       -- Float Switch: If the bucket full light is blinking or stays on when the bucket is empty, there may be an issue with the float switch. The switch can be found near the bucket, and is activated by the float mechanism when the bucket is full of water. This dehumidifier part is important because it also functions as a safety mechanism, to keep the appliance from overflowing with water. When the float switch is tripped, it signals the compressor and fan motor to stop working until the water is emptied from the bucket. To check the float switch, first make sure it isn't manually tripped by the float assembly. If everything appears normal, test the switch continuity using a multi-meter.
       -- Float Assembly: If the bucket full light stays on when the bucket is empty, there may be an issue with the float assembly. This dehumidifier part can be found near the bucket. It kicks in when the bucket fills with water to trip the float switch so the bucket doesn't overflow. When the float switch is activated, it stops the compressor and fan motor from working until the bucket can be emptied. To check the float assembly, check that it is moving freely and not being blocked by any other dehumidifier parts from coming in contact with the float switch. If you see any signs of damage, replace the float assembly.
       -- Control Board (PCB): If the dehumidifier bucket full light stays on but the bucket is empty, there may be an issue with the control board, also known as the PCB. This dehumidifier part is used in electronic control models to turn off the compressor and motor circuits when the bucket is full, via the float switch. If the control board is faulty, it may not accurately indicate when the bucket is full, meaning the light stays on even when the bucket is empty. Troubleshoot your dehumidifier by process of elimination, first making sure the issue is not the float assembly or switch before concluding the control board is faulty.
   - Coils icing over
   - Causes
       -- Humidity Control: If your dehumidifier coils are freezing up and the room temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be an issue with the humidity control. This control, also known as a humidistat, functions similarly to a thermostat to monitor the relative humidity level in the room. The humidistat electrical contacts power the compressor circuit to cycle on. If the humidistat is not reading the humidity correctly, the compressor will stay on which can cause the coils to freeze up. The electrical contacts can also become welded shut, leading to the same problem. To troubleshoot the humidistat, first disconnect power to the unit. Turn the humidistat dial and listen for the click that signals it is working properly. You can also test the control for continuity using a multi-meter. Keep in mind that as you rotate the control, the contacts should be open circuit, if not, it will need to be replaced.
       -- Blower Wheel or Fan Blade: If your dehumidifier coils are freezing up and the room temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be an issue with the blower wheel or fan blade. These two parts facilitate the air flow which is necessary for a dehumidifier to keep the condenser coils from freezing up. If the air filter is clean and there is no air flowing through the grille, remove the fan cover to visually inspect the coils. Remove any dirt or debris that could be impeding air flow. Check the blower wheel and fan blade to make sure nothing is blocking their movements. Take this opportunity to clean these parts, or replace them if they appear to be damaged. Manually rotate the fan motor to ensure it will move freely before restarting the unit.
       -- Fan Motor: If your dehumidifier coils are freezing up and the surrounding temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, the fan motor may be the issue. This dehumidifier part facilitates the air flow necessary to keep the condenser coils from freezing up.  To troubleshoot the dehumidifier fan motor, check to see if air is flowing from the grille, and that the air filter is clean of dirt and debris. Remove the fan cover and check for any signs of damage to the coils or fan. Take this opportunity to clean any parts that are dirty, and check to make sure the fan motor is able to rotate freely, with no objects blocking its way. Turn the unit to fan mode, and observe how the fan operates. Be very careful when performing this repair. If the fan hums but does not spin, or spins slowly, it will need to be replaced. If the fan neither hums nor spins, it should be tested by a qualified person, using a multi-meter.
       -- Bi-Metal Thermostat: If your dehumidifier condenser coils are freezing up even though the temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be an issue with the bi-metal thermostat. This part is included in certain dehumidifier models to keep the evaporator coils free of ice, particularly during periods of high humidity or low temperatures. The thermostat works by monitoring the temperature of the evaporator and causing the fan only to run, with the compressor stopped, to de-ice the coils. When the thermostat is faulty, it may not read the temperature correctly meaning the compressor will continue to run and the coils with freeze up. To troubleshoot this part, check to see if the bi-metal thermostat is making positive contact with the evaporator coil, if so, it means it is not working and needs to be replaced.
       -- Humidity or Temperature Sensor: If your dehumidifier condenser coils are freezing up even though the room temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be a problem with the humidity sensor, also known as the temperature sensor. This dehumidifier part is common on electronic control models. It monitors the ambient relative humidity, and in some cases, the temperature of the evaporator coil. It is important that the sensor reads the room temperature accurately, to signal the compressor to shut off to keep the coils from icing over. To troubleshoot this problem, first make sure that the sensor(s) are aligned correctly with the control board. Check the electronic control for a fault code which signals the sensor is faulty.
   - Won't start
   - Causes
       -- Float Assembly: If your dehumidifier won't work it may be because the compressor won't start, because it is not being signaled by the float assembly and switch. This dehumidifier part contacts the float switch when the bucket is full of water to prevent the unit from overflowing. To troubleshoot your dehumidifier, make sure the float assembly is not blocked, so that it can move around freely and come in contact with the float switch when it should. If the part appears to be damaged, you should replace it.
       -- Humidistat: If your dehumidifier won't work, there may be an issue with the humidistat, also known as the humidity control. This dehumidifier part supplies power to the compressor via electrical contacts when the humidity level in the air warrants it. Sometimes the electrical contacts can become welded shut or corroded, and are unable to signal the compressor to turn on. To perform this dehumidifier repair, turn the dial on the humidistat and listen for the click sound that indicates it is working. You can also test the contacts for continuity using a multi-meter. Replace the humidistat if you find it to be faulty.
       -- Sensor: If your dehumidifier won't work, it may be due to a faulty humidity sensor. This dehumidifier part is used on electronic control models, and signals the control board when it senses the relative humidity in the air. The control board signals the compressor to turn on. If the sensor is not working, the compressor won't cycle on because of an inaccurate reading of the humidity. To troubleshoot this part, inspect the harness connections to the control board to make sure they are in working order. If they appear to be damaged, replace the sensor.
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB: If your dehumidifier won't work, and it is an electronic control type, the issue may be the control board or PCB. The control board supplies the compressor and fan motor circuits with power, and will result in the dehumidifier not working if this part is faulty. To troubleshoot this issue, use process of elimination to make sure none of the other dehumidifier parts are causing this issue. If everything is working normally, the control board will likely need to be replaced.
       -- Auto Shut Off or Bucket Level Switch: Your dehumidifier may not be working because there is an issue with the auto shut off switch, also sometimes known as the bucket level switch. This switch is in place to keep the dehumidifier from overflowing when the bucket fills up with water. The float assembly signals the switch when the water level rises to a certain point, which results in the compressor and fan motor circuits shutting off. If your dehumidifier is not working but the bucket full switch is not on, the issue is likely with the shut off switch. Check to make sure the bucket is not full of water, and that the float assembly is able to come in contact with the switch properly. If everything appears normal, test the switch for continuity with a multi-meter.
   - Unit no longer pulling water from air
   - Causes
       -- Capacitor: If your dehumidifier is not collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be an issue with the capacitor in the compressor circuit. The compressor circulates refrigerant through the unit to remove moisture from the air, which collects in the bucket. If the capacitor fails, the compressor will not run. Signs that the capacitor is defective are that the overload device continually trips. A trained technician can perform a test to determine if the capacitor is faulty.
       -- Overload: If your dehumidifier is not collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, it likely means that the dehumidifier compressor is not working. This part can fail for a number of reasons, one of which is that the overload device has failed. The overload is a component of the compressor which keeps the motor from becoming damaged. If the overload is not working, the compressor won't work, meaning no water is being collected. The overload can be tested for continuity using a multi-meter. This part commonly fails when the unit is powered by extension cords which are too long or too small for the unit.
       -- Fan Motor: If your dehumidifier is not collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, there may be a problem with the fan motor. The fan motor keeps the air flowing across the evaporator coils to keep them from icing up. To troubleshoot this dehumidifier part, check to see if there is air coming through the grille. If there is no air blowing or very little, inspect the fan cover and evaporator coils to make sure they aren't blocked by dust and debris. Check to make sure the fan is able to rotate easily and that the blower wheel is securely attached to the motor shaft. Sometimes the fan motor will rotate slowly, or hum but not rotate at all, meaning it needs to be replaced. To observe the fan, you can operate the unit in fan only mode, but be very careful while doing this.
       -- Electronic Control Board or PCB Assembly: If your dehumidifier is not collecting water even though the room temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit, the electronic control board or PCB assembly may not be properly controlling the compressor and fan motor. The control board is a part on modern dehumidifiers, and uses sensors to monitor the ambient humidity and signal the compressor to start. To troubleshoot this part, you can perform a voltage test on the output relays with a multi-meter to make sure the relays and sensors are working.
Appliance: Freezer
Symptoms:
   - Too warm
   - Causes
       -- Temperature Control or Thermostat: The reason your freezer is not cold enough could be an issue with the temperature control or thermostat. The thermostat is a rotary dial with a capillary tube and sensor bulb which monitor the temperature, and electrical contracts which power the compressor circuit. Any of these parts can be damaged which will lead to this part failing. The contacts open and close, and can become damaged or corroded, meaning the compressor may not start and the freezer won't get cold enough. Try adjusting the thermostat to the highest setting, if the compressor starts then that confirms the temperature control should be replaced. Make sure not to disturb the sensor bulb when checking these components.
       -- User Control or Electronic Display Board: If your freezer is not cooling, the electronic display board may be causing the issue. The board, also known as a user control, displays, monitors, and adjusts the freezer temperature. If the control is not working, is may not be reading the temperature correctly and therefore not prompting the compressor circuit to begin cooling. Before concluding that the board is the issue, check the thermistor temperature sensor for damage.
       -- Defrost Timer: If your frost-free freezer will not get cold enough, there may be an issue with the defrost timer. The timer regularly cycles on the defrost heater to keep the evaporator coil free of frost buildup, allowing the cold air to circulate properly. To test the timer, manually turn it on to prompt the defrost cycle. If the evaporator defrosts, replace the defrost timer.
   - Unusual noise
   - Causes
       -- Evaporator Fan Motor: If you are hearing freezer fan noise from your frost-free model, the issue might be caused by the evaporator fan motor. This type of freezer has a fan motor which circulates air through the evaporator to be cooled. Over time, the fan motor parts can wear or lose lubrication, causing a humming, buzzing, or clicking noise in your freezer. To replace the fan motor, first unplug the power source to your freezer. You will then need to remove the grille or evaporator cover to access the motor.  Simply unplug the wire harness connector and remove the mounting screws.
       -- Evaporator Fan Blade: If your frost-free freezer is making a loud buzzing or humming noise, it could mean the evaporator fan blade is damaged. The evaporator fan cycles air over the evaporator coil to cool it. To access the evaporator fan to check for damage to the blade, look behind the air grille or evaporator cover, first disconnecting power to the appliance. The fan blade is typically attached to the motor shaft by a spring clip. Unclip the fan blade to replace it.
   - Won't start
   - Causes
       -- Start Relay or Controller: If your freezer will not freeze food, it may mean there is a problem with the compressor start relay. This part is also known as the controller, and works to power the compressor start windings to make your freezer start running. If the compressor start relay is not working, the compressor will not power on and begin freezing. Disconnect power to the freezer before beginning this repair. The compressor start relay is usually located on the side of the compressor. Use a multi-meter to test its continuity. Check for visible signs of damage caused by overheating, and replace as necessary.
       -- Electronic Control Board: If your freezer is not working or won't freeze, the issue may be with the control board. Typically, the control board works to display, monitor, and make adjustments to the freezer temperature, and is essential to the functionality of the compressor, evaporator fan and defrost heater circuits. Some freezer models have two separate control boards. If either board is not working, the compressor may not be prompted to start cooling the air. Check the control board to see if there are visual signs of damage, in which case it will need to be replaced. A voltage test can also be performed, but only by a qualified technician.
       -- Temperature Control or Thermostat: If your freezer has stopped working or is not freezing, there may be an issue with the temperature control thermostat. This thermostat is a rotary dial which has a capillary tube sensor that monitors the temperature of the interior lining of the freezer. It also has electrical contacts that send power to the compressor circuit when the freezer needs to begin cooling. If either the contacts or the sensor bulb are damaged, the compressor may not be prompted to start. In this case, the temperature control will need to be replaced. Unplug the freezer and inspect the control for damage. If there is none, check for continuity using a multi-meter.
       -- Start Capacitor: If your freezer stops working and will not freeze, it could be due to an issue with the start capacitor. This part helps power the compressor start windings, which prompt the unit to begin cooling. The compressor may make a humming noise but not start if the capacitor isn't working. Before checking the capacitor, which is usually on the side of the compressor, unplug the unit's power source. Check the capacitor for visual signs of damage or overheating and replace if it is defective. If there are no signs of damage, testing will need to be done by a qualified technician.
       -- Defrost Timer: If your frost-free freezer won't freeze or stops running, there may be an issue with the defrost timer. This part dictates the defrost cycle which keeps the evaporator coil free of frost buildup. The internal contacts in the defrost timer can fail, causing the timer to stall while in defrost mode, meaning the compressor will not be prompted to cool the air in the freezer. The timer is usually in the rear of the freezer, and can be turned on manually. If the compressor then starts, it means the defrost timer was the issue and needs to be replaced. If the compressor doesn't start at this point, it should have a live voltage test done by a qualified technician.
   - Frost buildup
   - Causes
       -- Defrost Thermostat: If your frost-free freezer has frost buildup, particularly around the evaporator, there may be an issue with the defrost thermostat. This type of freezer has a defrost heater to melt frost from the evaporator coil to keep it from frosting over. The defrost thermostat supplies power to the heater, and signals the shut-off when the defrost cycle is complete. You can test the functionality of the defrost thermostat using a multi-meter; it should have continuity when at freezing temperatures, and should be open circuit when the temperature is above 37 degrees Fahrenheit. A lack of continuity means your thermostat will not power the heater, leading to frost in the freezer.
       -- Door or Lid Gasket: If your freezer is frosting over, it may be due to a broken door lid or gasket. The gasket creates an airtight seal between the door and freezer cabinet to keep the air inside cold. If the gasket is damaged, it may be letting warm, moist air inside the freezer, which can result in frost when it comes in contact with the freezing cold surfaces inside. If the gasket on your frost-free model has a leak, frost can build up on the evaporator, which means the compressor has to run more than usual. Check the gasket for leaks or damage. If the frost is specific to one area, that is likely where the gasket leak is. Replace the gasket if you find any cracks or damage.
       -- Defrost Timer: If you are noticing frost in your freezer, it may mean there is an issue with the defrost timer. In frost-free freezer models, a defrost heater is used to melt frost before it can build up on the evaporator coil. The timer signals the heater to turn on at regular intervals for efficient operation. If the timer is not working, the heater will not run as usual and the compressor may run continuously. You can turn on the defrost timer manually to begin the defrost cycle; if the other components work normally, that means the timer is defective and needs to be replaced.
   - Doesn't stop running
   - Causes
       -- Temperature Control or Thermostat: If your freezer won't stop running and you are wondering if it has been running for too long, there may be a problem with the thermostat, also known as the temperature control. The thermostat is a rotary dial with a capillary tube and bulb sensor attached to the interior liner of the freezer. The thermostat has internal electrical contacts which power the compressor circuit. These contacts are prone to welding or sticking closed. Check the thermostat for damage to the sensor bulb or the contacts, and replace the thermostat if you find any.  Make sure to properly position the sensor bulb when replacing the temperature control.
       -- Defrost Timer: If your frost-free freezer is constantly running, but is not cold enough, there may be an issue with the defrost timer. This type of freezer has a defrost heater to keep frost from building up on the evaporator coil. The defrost timer cycles the heater on when it is needed to defrost the evaporator. Failure of the timer can result in the compressor running continuously. To test the timer, manually advance it to prompt the defrost cycle. If the evaporator defrosts as usual, it means the timer is the problem and needs to be replaced.
       -- Defrost Thermostat: If your frost-free freezer won't stop running but doesn't ever get cold enough, the defrost thermostat may be the source of the issue. The defrost heater circuit functions to keep the evaporator coil free of frost buildup. A properly functioning defrost thermostat allows the heater circuit to be powered in the defrost cycle. The defrost thermostat then signals the circuit to end the defrost cycle when the frost has been sufficiently melted. To test the defrost thermostat, use a multi-meter to check for continuity. The thermostat should exhibit continuity when at freezing temperatures, and switch to open circuit when the temperature is above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. If the defrost thermostat does not have continuity, it should be replaced.
       -- User Control or Electronic Display Board: If your freezer is constantly running, the user control, also known as the electronic display board could be the problem. This part is a feature on some freezer models, and is used to display, monitor, and adjust the temperature inside the freezer. If the control is not working, the compressor and fan motors may run continuously. Check the thermistor temperature sensor before concluding that the control is the part which needs to be replaced.
       -- Defrost Heater: If your freezer runs all the time but never seems to get cold enough, it may mean there is an issue with the freezer defrost heater. Frost-free freezers have a defrost heater which keeps the evaporator coil free of frost buildup. The defrost timer prompts the heater to cycle on and melt the frost. If the heater is not working, the frost will build up and can cause other parts to malfunction. Check the defrost heater for continuity using a multi-meter, with the ideal result being less than 30 ohms.
       -- Door or Lid Gasket: If your freezer won't stop running and the temperature is not being maintained correctly, it could be due to a fault door or lid gasket. The gasket creates a tight seal to preserve the cold air within the freezer. A gasket with cracks or leaks will lead to frost buildup on the evaporator, which causes the compressor to run continually. Check the gasket for any signs of damage. Areas where there is significant frost buildup can indicate where cracks or leaks are on the gasket. Replace a damaged gasket, and keep it in good condition by cleaning it frequently.
   - Too cold
   - Causes
       -- Temperature Control or Thermostat: Your freezer can be too cold, and the reason could be that the temperature control or thermostat isn't working properly. Rotary dial thermostats have a capillary tube and bulb sensor which attach to the interior lining of the freezer to monitor the temperature. The thermostat also has electrical contacts, which power the compressor circuit on and off to maintain the correct temperature. Over time, the contracts can become stuck closed, and the compressor will continue to run, making your freezer too cold. Another sign that the thermostat is the issue, is if the compressor is cycling on and off normally but the temperature remains too cold. In either case, the thermostat or temperature control should be replaced.
       -- User Control or Electronic Display Board: Your freezer can be too cold because the electronic display board doesn't shut off when the ideal freezer temperature is reached. The display board, also known as the user control, displays, monitors, and adjusts the temperature inside the freezer, and prompts the compressor, fan motor, and defrost heater to do their jobs. If the control board is not working, it won't read the temperature correctly, throwing off the compressor cooling circuit. Make sure to check the thermistor or temperature sensor before concluding the user control is the issue.
Appliance: Water Heater
Symptoms:
   - Water is too hot
   - Causes
       -- Control Thermostat: If your electric water heater gets too hot suddenly, the issue may be with the control thermostat. Find out how to test and replace your thermostat with this guide. The control thermostat regulates the hot water, between a range of 90 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Most electric water heaters in homes will have two thermostats: an upper and lower, which should be set to the same temperature. To repair the water heater thermostat you will need to determine which one is faulty. After running a significant amount of water, let the electric water heater sit for roughly half an hour, giving it enough time to stabilize the temperature. Shut off power to the heater and remove the access covers on the side of the tank. Pull aside the insulation and check the thermostats to see if they are properly aligned so that they come in contact with the tank wall. They should be adjusted to the same settings. Use a flat blade screwdriver to turn the dial to the highest and then lowest setting. The thermostat will make a click sound, indicating that the internal thermostat contacts open and close as they should. You can also test the continuity of the thermostat using a multi-meter, while you turn the dial to get an accurate reading. If the contacts do not open when turned to the lowest setting, the thermostat will need to be replaced. To remove the thermostat, disconnect the wires and lift it out of the spring mounting bracket. When installing the new thermostat, ensure that the mounting bracket is secure and holds the thermostat flush against the tank. If you experience suddenly too hot water in your gas water heater, the issue will most likely be the valve assembly. The gas valve controls the temperature on gas models, and if your manual adjustments to the dial do not properly set the temperature, it will need to be replaced by a qualified technician.
   - Won't stay lit/keeps shutting off
   - Causes
       -- Thermocouple: If your gas water heater doesn't stay lit, you may have a defective thermocouple. Most gas fired water heaters use a standing pilot to ignite the main burner. The gas for the pilot assembly is supplied by the main gas valve and is monitored by the thermocouple. The thermocouple is a heat sensing probe that is part of the pilot assembly and sits just above the pilot flame. When the pilot light is functioning properly, the thermocouple will generate a small voltage that is fed back to the gas valve to keep the gas flowing to the pilot light. If the thermocouple is defective, it will not sense the flame and the gas valve will not receive the proper voltage signal to keep gas flowing to the pilot assembly. The thermocouple probe sits in the pilot flame continuously and will eventually burn out. Testing the thermocouple requires special test equipment and therefore replacing it is usually the most practical method of troubleshooting. Verify that the pilot flame is clean and contacts the end of the probe fully before condemning the thermocouple. Changing the thermocouple does not involve any gas fittings but local regulations may require that a qualified gas technician perform the repair.
       -- Thermostatic Control /Gas Valve: If your gas water heater doesn't stay lit, you may have a defective control thermostat. This control is part of the gas valve assembly and normally has a dial that will allow for temperature adjustment and will also have a probe that monitors the water temperature. The gas supply to the pilot assembly is controlled by this valve.  If the pilot light won't stay lit and the thermocouple is okay, then the thermostatic control valve may be defective. Replacement of this part should be performed by a trained gas technician.
   - Water temperature changes between hot and cold
   - Causes
       -- Control Thermostat: If your hot water heater temperature switches between hot and cold, there may be a problem with the control thermostat. Your water heater has two thermostats, an upper and lower. Fluctuations between hot and cold temperatures indicate that only the upper water heater circuit is working. This thermostat supplies power to the upper heating element, and diverts power to the lower element once the ideal temperature is reached in the water at the top of the tank. If the upper thermostat fails to send power to the lower one, it will not heat the water toward the bottom of the tank. To repair your hot water heater, you must find out which thermostat is causing this problem. Turn off power to the water heater, open a hot water faucet and wait for the temperature to drop to a safe level. Remove the lower access cover from the side of the tank, push aside the insulation cover and remove the wires that are attached to the lower thermostat. Use a multi-meter to test the continuity of the thermostat. Set the meter to R 1 ohms, and measure the terminals of the thermostat. No continuity means the thermostat is not working and should be replaced. To replace it, lift the spring mounting bracket off and secure the new one in place, making sure it is firmly placed against the side of the tank. If the thermostat appears to be in order, check the lower element for continuity using your multi-meter. If it is also functioning, you will need to test the upper thermostat. To do this test, the water must be hot enough for the upper thermostat to direct power to the lower one, meaning your water heater must have power for long enough to heat the water. Once this has happened, turn it back off, and remove the upper access cover to access the thermostat the same way you did with the lower one. Remove the wires from terminals L1 and T4. Check for continuity between these two terminals (as long as the water has reached the ideal temperature). If there is no continuity, it means the upper thermostat needs to be replaced. For gas water heaters, the gas valve controls the temperature. The valve assembly features a dial which you can use to adjust the temperature. If the water temperature fluctuates but the pilot light is on, the gas valve assembly is probably at fault. This repair will need to be done by a qualified technician.
       -- Lower Heater Element: If your hot water temperature changes between hot and cold unpredictably, you may need to test the lower hot water heater element. On home water heaters, there is an upper and lower thermostat, and the upper one diverts power to the lower one when the water at the top of the tank reaches the correct temperature. If the lower element isn't working, the water temperature will fluctuate. To test the element, turn off power to the heater and remove the lower access cover. Push aside the insulation and disconnect the wires from the heating element. Use a multi-meter, set to R 1, to test for continuity. It should have continuity between 10 to 20 ohms between the two terminals. If the heating element has continuity, check the thermostat for continuity. If it has none, the thermostat will need to be replaced. In order to replace the element, you will need to drain the tank. To drain the tank, shut off the inlet water valve, attach a hose to the drain valve, open the drain valve and hot water faucet and wait until the water is lower than the heater element. Remove the element with a socket or element wrench, and ensure that the new gasket is secure in place as you tighten the new element. Connect the wires to the element terminals and shut the drain valve before refilling the tank. Keep an eye out for leaks before turning the power back on.
   - Leaking water
   - Causes
       -- Drain Valve: If your hot water heater is leaking, the drain valve could be the source of the leak. This part is located on the side of the tank, and is usually made of plastic. Visually inspect the valve to see if this is where the water is coming from. If you notice a leak, check to see if it is a result of sediment buildup in the tank by opening the valve a few turns and then re-tightening it. If the leak continues, it will need to be replaced. Shut off power to the water heater before beginning this repair. For a gas water heater, set the gas valve to pilot only. Shut off the cold water inlet valve, and connect a hose to the drain valve to drain the tank. Take off the current valve with a pipe wrench or adjustable pliers. Clean the valve threads and use pipe dope or Teflon tape on the new valve threads before tightening the new valve in place. Make sure the outlet is facing down on the new valve as you tighten it, before refilling the tank and turning the power back on.
       -- Temperature Pressure Relief Valve: If your hot water tank is leaking, the issue could be with the pressure relief valve. Residential hot water heaters have a pressure relief valve on the side of the tank, which functions as a safety device to keep the tank intact in the event of a buildup of pressure. Typically this valve has a plastic or copper extension tube to expel any discharge. The best solution for a leaking relief valve is to replace the valve. Turn off power to the heater, or set the gas valve to pilot only for gas models, before beginning this repair. Shut off the cold water inlet valve, and connect a hose to the drain valve to drain the tank. Be careful as the water will be very hot. After turning off the power or gas, you could turn on a tap in your home to run the hot water until it drops to a safer temperature before you start to drain the tank. Open a hot water faucet to let air into the tank, and the drain valve to let the water drain. Once the water is drained to below the relief valve, take off the current valve with a pipe wrench. Clean off the tank body threads and use pope dope or Teflon tape on the new valve threads before securing it in place. Tighten the valve in place, with the valve outlet facing downward.
       -- Element Gasket: If water is leaking from the bottom of your electric water heater, the problem may be the heater element gasket. The heating elements on your water heater can be accessed (found) behind access covers on the side of the water tank. Turn off power to the heater before beginning this repair. Remove the screws that hold the covers in place, and push aside the insulation to check for a leak. Look closely for leaks where the element is attached to the tank. To replace the gasket, you will have to drain the tank. Shut off the cold water inlet valve, and connect a hose to the drain valve to drain the tank. Place the hose in a floor drain, and open the drain valve and a hot water faucet to let air into the tank while it expels hot water. Be careful as the water will be very hot. To avoid coming in contact with the hot water, you can first run a hot water tap in your home until the water drops in temperature. Drain the water until it is below the heating element. Remove the element using a socket or element wrench, and take this opportunity to clean the mounting flange. Remove the old gasket before putting the new one in place. Reattach the element, making sure it is secure, and then reconnect the wires to its terminals. Close any open valves, and put the access covers back in place before turning the power back on.
   - Water isn't getting hot
   - Causes
       -- Heater Element: If your electric water heater is not heating, it may be due to an issue with the heater element. Home water heaters typically have an upper and lower heating element. If your water is not heating, it is most likely because of a faulty upper heating element, whereas if some hot water is present but not much, it is most likely a problem with the lower heating element You can test the heaters with a multi-meter for functionality. Shut off power to the water heater and take off the access covers from the side of the tank. Push the insulation to one side to access the elements. Disconnect the two wires to each element, and set the multi-meter to R 1. Your meter should read between 10 and 20 ohms of resistance for either the upper or lower element. When testing between the terminals and the body of the tank, there should be no continuity. If you get different results, the element will need to be replaced, which requires draining the water tank. To repair your hot water heater element,  first shut off the inlet water valve and use a hose to funnel out water via the drain valve. Drain the water until the level is below the opening of the element. Be careful when dealing with hot water. To avoid incidents, you can run a tap in your home to drain much of the hot water before draining the tank. Remove the element using a socket or element wrench. Ensure that the gasket is secured in place and the new element is tightened properly. Reconnect the wire to the element terminals, shut the drain valve, and fill the tank back up. Keep an eye out for leaks during this repair.
       -- Control Thermostat: If your electric water heater isn't heating, there may be an issue with the control thermostat. This thermostat regulates the water in your hot water heater, normally between a range of 90 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Most home water heaters have an upper and lower thermostat, which should be set to the same temperature. To test each thermostat, first shut off power to the unit, then remove the access covers located on the side of the tank. Push aside the insulation and make sure the upper thermostat reset button has not been tripped. Make sure both thermostats are showing the same settings. Check for continuity using a multi-meter, if the water in the tank is below 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Check the upper thermostat for continuity between terminals L1 and T2 and the bottom thermostat between terminals 1 and 2. If there is no continuity below 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the thermostat is defective and needs to be replaced. Remove the wires and spring mounting bracket from the thermostat. Ensure that the new thermostat mounting bracket is firmly placed on the tank wall. For gas water heaters, the gas valve dictates the temperature. The valve assembly features a dial which allows you to control the temperature. When the pilot light is lit and you adjust the temperature but the water isn't getting hot, the valve assembly should be replaced, only by a qualified technician.
   - Unusual noise
   - Causes
       -- Heater Element: If your electric water heater is making a popping noise, the problem may be with the heater element. Unusual noises such as knocking, banging, hissing or humming in a residential electric hot water heater is usually a result of mineral deposits in the water tank. Mineral deposits due do hard water will coat the heater elements over time, trapping moisture between the coating and element. This moisture reaches a boiling point, causing the unusual noises. Repairing your hot water heater element simply requires cleaning the heating elements, unless they are coated beyond repair in which case they should be replaced. Turn off power to the water heater, and drain the tank. The access covers on the side of the tank can be removed, and then disconnect the wires from the element terminals. Make sure the inlet water valve is closed, and use a hose connected to the drain valve to drain the water until the level is lower than the heater element. Remove the element using a socket or element wrench, and then clean or replace it. If installing a new heater element, make sure the gasket is aligned properly and the element is secure. Connect the element wires back to the element and shut the drain valve. Turn the water inlet supply back on and fill the tank back up. Be sure to monitor for leaks at this point.
       -- Gas Water Heater: If your gas water heater is making noises such as popping, hissing, or knocking, the issue could be a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank. If you have hard or mineral-rich water it can cause minerals such as calcium and lime to coat the bottom of the tank. The moisture between the coating and tank wall boils and creates the unusual noise. To repair your gas water heater, you can flush the tank to rid the buildup. Turn the gas valve to off, or pilot only, and shut off the inlet water valve. Use a hose to connect to the drain valve; open the drain valve and the hot water faucet. Wait until the heater tank is completely empty, and then open and shut the inlet water valve several times to ensure all the water and sediment is flushed. Keep an eye on the water; when it is clear you can close the drain valve and refill the tank.
Appliance: Food Waste Disposer
Symptoms:
   - Garbage comes back up sink
   - Causes
       -- Splash Guard: If food comes back up your garbage disposal, the issue may be a faulty splash guard. Check to make sure the drain is clear before concluding that the splash guard needs to be replaced. This part is made of rubber which can break down over time and become rigid, at which point it needs to be replaced. Check the splash guard for signs of damage and replace if necessary.
   - Unusual noise
   - Causes
       -- Grinding Chamber: If your garbage disposal is making a loud humming, grinding, or rattling noise, it could be the result of a jammed grinding chamber. Food or other debris can become trapped in the chamber, resulting in the unusual noise. Shut off power to the disposal and visually inspect the sink opening for a jam. You can access the grinding plate with a long object to rotate it, or go through the bottom of the unit with a special offset wrench to turn the plates manually and dislodge the jam. If there is no visible jam, the issue may be the motor or motor start capacitor. The noise could also be the result of a defective grinding plate, grinding ring, or motor assembly. These parts are not usually available as replacements, which means the garbage disposal would need to be replaced.
   - Won't stay on
   - Causes
       -- Start Switch Kit: If your garbage disposal starts but won't stay running, there may be an issue with the start switch. On batch feed style models, the start switch is activated by the stopper cam, which rotates to come in contact with the start switch actuator. To troubleshoot this problem, first turn off power to the unit, and remove the switch cover. Take out the start switch assembly and check for damage, particularly to the actuator. Take this opportunity to visually inspect other surrounding parts for damage, such as the stopper cam, and replace any that appear to be damaged.
       -- Stopper: If your garbage disposal won't stay running, the issue may be with the stopper. The stopper is used to start the unit by hitting the start switch on most batch feed models. The stopper has a projection or cam which can become worn over time, or damaged, resulting in it not making contact with the start switch actuator. Check the stopper for signs of damage, and the other parts as well, such as the start switch actuator. Disconnect power to the disposal before replacing any of these parts.
   - Smells bad
   - Causes
       -- Splash Guard: If your garbage disposal has a bad odor, it may mean the splash guard needs to be replaced. This part is made of rubber, and goes just inside the drain opening. The rubber will break down over time and can retain bad smells from the food waste that passes through. Examine the splash guard for missing pieces or rigidity, which indicates that it is time to replace it. To clean the garbage disposal, make a habit of occasionally grinding up lemons, and regularly flushing with cold water. For a deeper clean, add baking soda or white vinegar to your garbage disposal cleaning routine.
       -- Stopper: If your garbage disposal has a bad odor, the problem may be the stopper. On certain disposals, the stopper and splash guard function together as one part. The stopper is made of rubber and can break down over time, becoming more prone to absorbing smells from food waste. The rubber stopper can become rigid and damaged over time, and does not create an airtight seal which also helps to keep powerful food smells contained. In some cases the splash guard may be missing completely. Check to see if your splash guard is damaged or dislodged, and replace if necessary. To help keep your garbage disposal clean, run a lemon through it occasionally and flush with cold water often. For a deeper clean you can also add baking soda and vinegar to your cleaning routine.
   - Leaking
   - Causes
       -- Flange Gasket: If your garbage disposal is leaking from the sink connection, the issue may be the sink flange gasket. Inspect this rubber gasket visually to see if it is out of place or damaged. The flange gasket forms a seal; if it is damaged is could be the reason your disposal is leaking water. Before replacing this part, shut off power to the unit. Make sure to properly tighten the mounting flange before continuing to use your garbage disposal.
       -- Tailpipe or Tailpipe Gasket: If your garbage disposal is leaking water near the drain elbow or tailpiece connection, the issue may be the tailpipe gasket. This part is usually made of rubber, and creates a seal between the tailpiece and the body of the disposal. Over time the rubber can break down and cause a leak. To fix your leaking garbage disposal, take off the flange which holds the tailpipe and disposer together and then take off the tailpipe. Take this opportunity to clean the area where the gasket goes, and check for damage to the tailpipe itself. Install the new gasket and make sure all parts are reassembled securely before running the disposal again.
       -- Flex Coupling: If your garbage disposal is leaking from the drain connection, the problem could be the flex coupling. This part is used on some disposal models to connect the drain tailpipe to the unit. This coupling can become damaged over time, causing your garbage disposal to leak water. To replace the coupling, first remove the tailpipe by taking off the clamps which hold it in place. Remove the coupling from the drain chamber. You may need to undo a clip, flange, or screw which holds the coupling in place. Take this opportunity to clean the area where the coupling goes, to ensure a watertight seal. Also check the other parts for signs of damage before installing your new coupling. Run water through the garbage disposal before running it again to make sure it is no longer leaking.
       -- Internal Seal: If your garbage disposal is leaking from the bottom, it's a sign that an internal seal has failed and is causing the leak. This part is known and a boot or shaft seal, and is placed below the grinding plate to prevent leaks to the motor housing. Certain fibrous foods such as banana peels or corn husks can persist through the grinding chamber and cause damage to the seal. If this seal fails, the entire disposal unit will usually need to be replaced.
   - Won't start
   - Causes
       -- Disposal Stopper: If your garbage disposal won't turn on, troubleshoot the problem by hitting the reset button. If that doesn't make it start working, there may be an issue with the disposal stopper. This is applicable to batch feed style models. On this type of model, the stopper activates the start switch via a projector or cam which rotates and comes in contact with the start switch. If this part is damaged, it may not make full contact with the start switch actuator, meaning your disposal won't turn on. Turn off power to the unit and check the stopper and actuator for any signs of damage. If your model has a magnetic switch, make sure it is still magnetized. If any of these parts are damaged, they will need to be replaced.
       -- Start Switch Kit: If your garbage disposal is not working or won't turn on, try hitting the reset button which is usually located on the bottom of the disposal. If the reset button doesn't make the disposal turn on, there may be an issue with the start switch kit. Batch feed style garbage disposals have a start switch which is activated when it comes in contact with the stopper. To check the functionality of the start switch, first shut off power to the unit. Remove the switch cover, located on the side of the disposal. Make sure the stopper is properly aligned so that it comes in contact with the switch. Check the switch for continuity using a multi-meter. If the switch actuator or stopper cam are damaged, they will need to be replaced. Some garbage disposals have a magnetic switch; check to make sure it has not been demagnetized.
